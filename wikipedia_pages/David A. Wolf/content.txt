David Alexander Wolf(born August 23, 1956) is an American astronaut,medical doctorandelectrical engineer.[1]Wolf has been to space four times. Three of his spaceflights were short-durationSpace Shuttlemissions, the first of which wasSTS-58in 1993, and his most recent spaceflight wasSTS-127in 2009. Wolf also took part in a long-duration mission aboard the Russianspace stationMirwhich lasted 128 days, and occurred duringMir EO-24. He was brought toMiraboardSTS-86in September 1997, and landed aboardSTS-89in January 1998. In total Wolf has logged more than 4,040 hours in space. He is also a veteran of seven spacewalks totaling 41hrs 17min in both Russian and American spacesuits.

Education
David A. Wolf was born inIndianapolis,Indiana, United States and graduated fromNorth Central High School. Wolf then went on to earn a degree in electrical engineering fromPurdue University, where he graduated with distinction and became a brother in theAlpha Tau Omegafraternity. In 1982, he earned a medical degree fromIndiana University School of Medicine. He subsequently trained as a flight surgeon with theUnited States Air Force. Wolf joined the staff ofJohnson Space Centerin 1983 and investigated the physiological effects ofmicrogravity.[1][2]

Honors and organizations
David Wolf has received numerous awards and honors. He is a recipient of theNASA Exceptional Engineering Achievement Medalin 1990 andNASA Inventor of the Yearin 1992. Wolf received anAcademic Achievement Awardupon graduation from medical school. He received theCarl R. Ruddell scholarshipaward for research in medical ultrasonic signal and image processing. He is a member ofEta Kappa NuandPhi Eta Sigmahonorary societies. Wolf has received 15 U.S. Patents and over 20 Space Act Awards primarily for 3-dimensional tissue engineering technologies, earning theTexas State Bar Patentof the Year in 1994. He has published over 40 technical papers.[1]
Dave Wolf is a member of theInstitute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers, theAerospace Medical Association, theExperimental Aircraft Association, theInternational Aerobatic Club, and theIndiana Air National Guard(retired).
The City of Indianapolis honored Wolf by namingMarion County Bridge 0501F(carrying E. 82nd St. over theWhite River) the "Astronaut David Wolf Bridge."[3]

NASA career
David Wolf began his NASA career in the Medical Sciences Division at theJohnson Space CenterinHouston,Texas. He was responsible for engineering development and spacecraft avionics integration of the American Flight Echocardiograph for investigating cardiovascular physiology in microgravity. Upon completion, he was assigned as chief engineer for design of the Space Station medical facility, directly responsible for multidisciplinary team management, requirements definition, system design, spacecraft systems integration, project schedule, functional and safety verification, and budgetary authority. Dave Wolf was selected by NASA as an astronaut candidate in 1990. He completed 18 months of training before being qualified for flight. He was assigned toKennedy Space CenterinFloridawhere he was involved in Orbiter vehicle processing and testing and as aCapcom(including for the historic docking of Space Shuttle Atlantis with Space Station Mir in 1995). He is an expert in Extravehicular Activity (Spacewalk), Spacesuit design, and Rendezvous navigation. Some of his other qualifications include Robotic Manipulator System (Robot Arm) operations, on-orbit systems repair, computer networking, and as Shuttle re-entry flight deck engineer.[1]
During his training for aMirexpedition, he lived and trained inStar City, Russia at theYuri Gagarin Cosmonaut Training Center. Wolf became fluent in Russian, as all of his training there was in Russian.
Wolf and fellow Jewish astronautJeffrey A. Hoffmanhad "a running battle, a running argument on who has the longestdreidelspin." Other Jewish artifacts he took into space and brought back include "ayad– a Torah pointer, and .. a small menorah."[4]

Spaceflight experience

STS-58
David Wolf served as mission specialist 3 aboardColumbiaduring theSTS-58mission. STS-58, designated Spacelab Life Sciences 2, was the second dedicated mission to study regulatory physiology, cardiovascular/cardiopulmonary, musculoskeletal and neuroscience. The mission lasted 14 days, 0 hours, 12 minutes and 32 seconds.Columbialanded atEdwards Air Force BaseinCalifornia. At the time of landing STS-58 was the longest duration mission flown.[5]

Mir Expedition 24
Wolf flew aboardAtlantisonSTS-86in September 1997. Wolf was only on board for a short time as he was being transported to the RussianMirspace station.Atlantisdocked with theMirspace station on September 27, 1997, which marked the start of Dave Wolf's stay onMir.[6]
David Wolf spent 128 days aboard space stationMir. He conducted a number of experiments and studies including, advanced microgravity tissue engineering techniques, electromagnetic levitation platform capability, colloid behavior, radio-tracer studies of altered human erythropoetic function, and human microgravity physiology studies. During his stay, there were a number of systems failures including multiple failed spacecraft systems, including atmospheric life support, three total power system failures, loss ofattitude control, primary computer system failure, humidity separation system loss. An emergency ingress had to be made during an EVA performed in the RussianOrlan space suitdue to airlock hatch failure.[7]The entire mission and training were conducted solely in Russian.[8]
While aboardMir, Wolf became the first American to vote from space, casting a ballot in a 1997 local election.[9]
STS-89was David Wolf's return ride home to earth. STS-89 docked withMiron January 24, 1998, marking the end of Wolf's stay onMir.Endeavourtouched down on January 31, 1998.[7]

STS-112
Dave Wolf flew aboardAtlantisduring theSTS-112mission. STS-112 delivered theS1 truss segmenttheInternational Space Station(ISS).Atlantislaunched on October 7, 2002, from Kennedy Space Center. Wolf conducted 3 spacewalks, to install the S1 truss segment and other EVA hardware. He spent a total of 19hrs and 1 minute outside the ISS.Atlantislanded on October 18, 2002, ending STS-112 at 10 days, 19 hours, 58 minutes and 44 seconds.[10]

STS-127
David Wolf last flew onEndeavourduring theSTS-127(2J/A) mission. The STS-127 launched on July 15, 2009, and the mission delivered the Japanese Experiment Logistics Module – Exposed Section (ELM-ES) and new expedition memberTimothy Kopra. STS-127 was originally scheduled to launch in June 2009 but was delayed after a leak was detected at the gaseous hydrogen vent line. A second attempt was made 3 days after the first try but was scrubbed for the same problem. A third launch attempt was canceled due to bad weather and a further delay occurred when lightning struck near the pad. Wolf conducted 3 spacewalks, totaling 18hrs 24min. STS-127 landed on July 31, 2009, and lasted 15 days, 16hrs, 44min and 58seconds.[11]
