Julie Payette(French pronunciation:[ʒylipajɛt]; born October 20, 1963) is a Canadian engineer, scientist and former astronaut who served as the 29thgovernor general of Canadafrom 2017 to 2021.[1][2][3]
Payette holds engineering degrees fromMcGill Universityand theUniversity of Toronto. She worked as a research scientist before joining theCanadian Space Agency(CSA) in 1992 as a member of theCanadian Astronaut Corps. She completed two spaceflights,STS-96andSTS-127, and has logged more than 25 days in space. She also served ascapsule communicatoratNASA Mission Control CenterinHoustonand from 2000 to 2007 as CSA's chief astronaut.
In July 2013, Payette was named chief operating officer for theMontreal Science Centre. She also held a number of board appointments, including theNational Bank of Canada.[4]On July 13, 2017, Prime MinisterJustin Trudeauannounced that QueenElizabeth IIhad approved the appointment of Payette as the next governor general of Canada.[1][2][5]She was invested on October 2, 2017.[6]
Payette resigned on January 21, 2021, following the conclusion of aworkplace reviewthat found she had "belittled, berated and publicly humiliatedRideau Hallstaff" and "created a toxic, verbally abusive workplace".[7]The review was initiated by thePrivy Council Officeto investigate accusations of harassment of civil servants in the Office of the Governor General.[8]The report's official goal was not to validate nor make findings of fact, as it only relied on what interview participants reported.[9]
She is the second governor general to have resigned the office (the first beingRoméo LeBlanc, who resigned due to health issues); the first to resign due to scandal; and the first to have left a vacancy upon resignation.[10][11]

Education and early career
Payette was born on October 20, 1963, inMontreal,Quebec,[12]and lived in theAhuntsicneighbourhood, attending Collège Mont-Saint-Louis andCollège Regina Assumpta.[13][14]In 1982 she completed anInternational Baccalaureatediploma at theUnited World College of the AtlanticinSouth Wales, United Kingdom.[15]
For her undergraduate studies, Payette enrolled inMcGill Universitywhere she completed aBachelor of Engineeringdegree inelectrical engineeringin 1986, after which she completed aMaster of Applied Sciencedegree incomputer engineeringat theUniversity of Torontoin 1990. Her thesis focused oncomputational linguistics, a field ofartificial intelligence.[13][16][17]She is a retired member of theOrdre des ingénieurs du Québec.[18][19]
She speaks French and English, some Spanish, Italian, Russian and German.[20]
During her schooling, between 1986 and 1988, Payette also worked as asystems engineerforIBMCanada's Science Engineering division. From 1988 to 1990, as a graduate student at the University of Toronto, she was involved in a high-performance computer architecture project and worked as a teaching assistant. At the beginning of 1991, Payette joined the communications and science department of theIBM Zurich Research Laboratoryin Switzerland, for a one-year visiting scientist appointment. When she returned to Canada, in January 1992, she joined the Speech Research Group of Bell-Northern Research in Montreal where she was responsible for a project in telephone speech comprehension using computervoice recognition.[21]

Canadian Space Agency
Payette was selected by theCanadian Space Agency(CSA) as one of four astronauts from a field of 5,330 applicants in June 1992. After undergoing basic training in Canada, she worked as a technical advisor for theMobile Servicing System, an advanced robotics system and Canada's contribution to theInternational Space Station.[19]In 1993, Payette established the Human-Computer Interaction Group at the Canadian Astronaut Program and served as a technical specialist on theNATOInternational Research Study Group on speech processing.[22]
In preparation for a space assignment, Payette obtained her commercialpilotlicence and logged 120 hours as a research operator on reduced gravity aircraft. In April 1996, Payette was certified as a one-atmosphere deep seadiving suitoperator. Payette obtained her captaincy on theCT-114 Tutormilitary jet atCFB Moose Jawin February 1996 and her military instrument rating in 1997. Payette has logged more than 1,300 hours of flight time,[16]including 600 hours on high-performance jet aircraft.
Payette reported to theJohnson Space Centerin August 1996 to begin mission specialist training. After completing one year of training, she was assigned to work on the Mobile Servicing System.[23]Payette completed the initial astronaut training in April 1998.[24]

Spaceflight experience
Payette served as chief astronaut for the Canadian Space Agency from 2000 to 2007. She also worked ascapsule communicatorat the Mission Control Center in Houston for several years, including the return to flight missionSTS-114. She was lead capsule communicator duringSTS-121.[16]
Payette flew on theSpace ShuttleDiscoveryfrom May 27 to June 6, 1999, as part of the crew ofSTS-96. During the mission, the crew performed the first manual docking of the shuttle to the International Space Station, and delivered four tons of logistics and supplies to the station. OnDiscovery, Payette served as amission specialist. Her main responsibility was to operate theCanadarmrobotic arm from the space station.[25]The STS-96 mission was accomplished in 153 orbits of the Earth, traveling over six million kilometres (3,700,000 mi) in 9 days, 19 hours and 13 minutes. Payette became the first Canadian to participate in an ISS assembly mission and to board the Space Station.[19]
Payette visited the space station again in 2009 as a mission specialist aboardSpace ShuttleEndeavourduring missionSTS-127from July 15 to 31, 2009, and was the flight engineer and lead robotic operator during the mission.[26]At that time,Robert Thirskwas a member ofExpedition 20on the space station.Endeavour's docking at the space station marked the first time two Canadians met in space.[27]
During her second mission, Payette brought a signed sweater of the famedMontreal CanadiensplayerMaurice Richard, stating she had brought Richard, who was known as "The Rocket", into the rocket to celebratethe hockey team's 100th anniversary.[28]

Post-CSA
During 2011–2013, she worked at theWoodrow Wilson International Center for Scholarsin Washington, D.C., and was also a scientific delegate to the United States for the Quebec Government.[29][30][31]
For the next three years, Payette was chief operating officer of theMontreal Science Centreof theSociété du Vieux-Port de Montréal.[32]During that time, she was also a vice president of theCanada Lands Company.[22][33]She abruptly left the Science Centre after a prolonged strike, as she was tired of the battles that came with her position.[34]Prior to her departure numerous employees came forward alleging verbal abuse that created a hostile working environment, as Payette was "intimidating" and "determined to be very hands-on and in control of every aspect".[35]
In April 2016, Payette was appointed to the board of theCanadian Olympic Committee, and attended the2016 Summer Olympics. She left the Canadian Olympic Committee in 2017 after two internal investigations into her treatment of staff including verbal harassment.[36]In about 2017, she was appointed to theInternational Olympic Committee's Women in Sports Commission.[31][37]
Payette has served on boards of directors, atQueen's University, Canada'sOwn the PodiumOlympic program,Montreal Science Centrefoundation, Robotique FIRST Québec, Drug Free Kids Canada, the Montreal Bach Festival, theNational Bank of Canada, Développement Aéroport Saint-Hubert de Longueuil, and others. She is a member of the Ordre des ingénieurs du Québec and a fellow of the International Academy of Astronautics. As well, Payette is a member of the Faculty of Engineering Advisory Board of McGill University.[31]

Governor General of Canada
Payette was announced on July 13, 2017, as Prime MinisterJustin Trudeau's recommendation to be the29thGovernor General of Canada. She was scheduled to take office October 2, 2017, after the completion of briefings from the incumbent,David Johnston.[38]After the announcement was made, Johnston issued a statement congratulating Payette and welcoming "a Canadian of extraordinary achievement, admired by all".[39]
As governor general-designate, Payette had her first official meeting with QueenElizabeth IIon September 20, 2017, atBalmoral Castle, when she was also invested by Her Majesty as an extraordinary Companion of theOrder of Canada(CC), an extraordinary Commander of theOrder of Military Merit(CMM), and a Commander of theOrder of Merit of the Police Forces(COM).[40]
Payette was installed as governor general on October 2, 2017. Afterwards, she urged Canadians to work together on issues such as climate change, migration and poverty. "Anyone can accomplish anything and rise to the challenge as long as they are willing to work with others, to let go of the personal agenda, to reach a higher goal and to do what is right for the common good. This is exactly what I hope my mandate as the governor-general will reflect", Payette said.[41]

Tenure
As she was completing her first year as the viceregal representative in September 2018, Payette faced some criticism about controversial comments she had made against those who believe increationismand those whodid not believe in climate change. At the Canadian Science Policy Conference the next month, she argued strongly for greater public acceptance of science, saying that too many people believe in astrology, deny climate change, and believe that "maybe taking a sugar pill will cure cancer".[42][43][44][45]ASkeptical Inquirerarticle described her remarks as "refreshing". George Dvorsky from Gizmodo.com stated "Her words were a breath of fresh air".[46]
In subsequent comments, Payette emphasized the importance of debate and critical thinking but admitted that she was still growing into her role and needed more time to adapt to the position. "I learned that you have to be careful about how you say things, but not what you say", she added.[47]Some time later, she offered an additional explanation to CPAC. "I made a speech as I had as an astronaut and I'm not an astronaut any longer, I'm governor general. I represent all Canadians. I've learned those lessons."[48]
Weeks later, she faced criticism about her work ethic, with some suggesting that she had not devoted enough time and dedication to the role of governor general, noting that she had not visited several of the provinces in her nearly 12-month tenure.[48]TheToronto Starpublished specifics confirming the more numerous appearances her two predecessors had made per year.[49]Rideau Hall spokesperson Marie-Ève Létourneau said that "The first year of every mandate is a period of learning, adjustment and adaptation from both the Governor General and Rideau Hall staff."[50]The Governor General office's lengthy review of patronage activities, that her predecessors had automatically done by longstanding tradition, left several established non-profit groups without committed support from the office and facing organizational changes.[51]
Later in September, the Governor General's office confirmed that Payette would not preside over the 2018 Governor General's History Awards ceremony.[52]
On September 27, Payette acknowledged the articles that had painted an "unfavourable image of our work" in an e-mail to staff, expressed regret about the effect of the criticisms on morale, and assured them that she was "very proud of all we have achieved together to date".[48]
During Payette's tenure, the media also raised concerns over questionable spending projects at Rideau Hall and her refusal to move in to Rideau Hall after renovations were complete.[53]It was reported that the spending included around $140,000 on "studying and designing a private staircase that was never built" and $117,500 on "a gate and series of doors to keep people away from Payette's office".[54]With much of the grounds ofRideau Hallopen to the public, it was, however, recognized that there were current accessibility, privacy and security concerns, especially in light of the July 2nd security breach on the grounds by Corey Hurren.

Resignation
On July 21, 2020,CBC Newsreported that Payette had allegedly created a toxic work environment at Rideau Hall by verbally abusing employees.[55]Two days later, spurred on by the CBC News report, thePrivy Council Officeformallylaunched an investigationinto her conduct.[56]Many former employees of the Montreal Science Centre told theNational Postthey witnessed similarly abusive behaviour by Payette in her time at the institution, although others described her behaviour as the result of rigorously high standards.[34]Payette said that she supported the investigation into the workplace harassment.[8]The Privy Council Office's independent report found that Payette presided over a toxic work environment, detailing "yelling, screaming, aggressive conduct, demeaning comments and public humiliations."[7]
On January 21, 2021, in whatCBC Newsdescribed as "an unprecedented move", Payette announced her resignation as governor general (which was effective the following day) after the completion of an independent workplace review of several claims of workplace harassment (in the form of, "belittling, berating and publicly humiliating" staff), as remaining in her post "would risk inflicting serious damage on the office".[57]The secretary to the governor general played a critical role in Payette's downfall.[58][53]Payette's commission as Governor General was formally terminated by royalletters patentissued on January 22.[59]
Richard Wagner, theChief Justice of Canada, was sworn in asAdministratoron January 23, 2021.[60]
Trudeau was criticized by 15 sources interviewed by the CBC for failing to vet Payette properly, as the PMO did not conduct checks with Payette's past employers (Montreal Science CentreandCanadian Olympic Committee) that could have uncovered that her style and temperament were unsuited for the diplomatically sensitive and public role of Governor General.[36][11]
As a result of her resignation, renewed scrutiny arose around the pension and benefits afforded to retired governors general. Under current law, she will receive a lifetime pension of nearly $150,000 and also can claim an additional $206,000 in expenses each year.Carleton Universityacademic Philippe Lagassé has speculated that Payette's decision to resign may have been motivated by her desire to protect her entitlements, asParliamentwould be unlikely to retroactively reduce them.[61]

Personal life
Payette has been married and divorced twice, first to François Brissette in the 1990s,[62]and secondly to William Flynn, with whom she had a son in 2003,[63]and from whom she divorced in 2015.[64]Payette plays the piano and has sung with theMontreal Symphony OrchestraandTafelmusik Chamber Choir.[65]Currently, she sings with theOttawa Bach Choir.[66]Among her other hobbies are running, skiing, racquet sports, and scuba diving.[19]
In July 2011, Payette was driving and struck and killed a pedestrian who had stepped off a curb to cross the road. The case was closed in 2012 as she was found not at fault.[67]
She was also charged with second degree assault inMaryland, on November 24, 2011. At least one anonymously quoted source has alleged that the victim of the assault was her then-husband, Billie Flynn. Though the charges were later dropped, the couple split several weeks later and subsequently divorced. Payette has stated that charges were "unfounded" but refused to comment further on the circumstances leading to her being charged with assault.[68]These incidents raised questions on the vetting process as she had been selected by Prime Minister Trudeau without consulting an ad hoc committee of experts. Such a committee was the means by which outgoing Governor GeneralDavid Johnstonhad been selected by the Conservative government ofStephen Harper. Once Payette was named Governor General-designate, media organizations pressed for the release of the divorce records, which Payette initially attempted to keep sealed before abandoning the bid.[69][70]
