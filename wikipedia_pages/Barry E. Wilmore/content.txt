As a Navy test pilot, Wilmore participated in all aspects of the initial development of theT-45jet trainer to include initial carrier landing certification and high angle of attack flight tests. His test tour also included a stint at USNTPS as a systems and fixed wing "Flight Test" instructor. Prior to his selection to NASA, Wilmore was on exchange to the Air Force as a "Flight Test" instructor at theU.S. Air Force Test Pilot SchoolatEdwards Air Force Base,California.[1]

NASA experience
Wilmore was selected as a pilot byNASAin July 2000 and reported for training that August 2000. Following the completion of two years of training and evaluation, Wilmore was assigned technical duties representing the Astronaut Office on all propulsion systems issues including theSpace Shuttle Main Engines,solid rocket motor,external tank, and also served on the astronaut support team that traveled to theKennedy Space Center,Florida, in support of launch and landing operations.[1]

STS-129
In 2009, Wilmore piloted theSpace ShuttleAtlantisfor theSTS-129mission to theInternational Space Station.[11]

Expedition 41/42
Wilmore returned to space in September 2014 as a member of theSoyuz TMA-14Mlong duration International Space Station crew.[12]During this mission, humans manufactured off world for the first time. The International Space Station's 3-D printer, designed and built byMade In Space, Inc., was used to print a tool with a design file transmitted from the ground to the printer. The tool was a ratchet wrench needed by Wilmore, who would have had to wait for the tool to be delivered on the next supply mission from Earth. The wrench was later returned to the ground for analysis and testing, along with the other parts printed in space.

Boeing Crew Flight Test
On October 7, 2020, NASA and Boeing announced Wilmore would join astronautsMichael FinckeandNicole Mannfor NASA'sBoeing Crew Flight Test(CFT), the inaugural crewed flight of theCST-100 Starlinerlaunching to the International Space Station in 2021.[13]On April 18, 2022, NASA said that it has not finalized which of the cadre of Starliner astronauts, including Wilmore, Fincke, andSunita Williams, would fly on the Crewed Flight Test mission or the firstoperational Starliner mission.[14]On June 16, 2022, NASA confirmed that CFT will be a two-person flight test, consisting of Wilmore and Williams.[15]On June 5, 2024, Starliner was launched successfully to orbit with Williams as the spacecraft's pilot. On June 6, Starliner docked to theISSafter over a day in space.[16]
The mission was meant to last eight days, ending with a landing in thesouthwestern United Stateson June 14. However, the capsule's thrusters malfunctioned as Starliner docked with the ISS. Despite months of testing, NASA felt it was not able to understand why the thrusters malfunctioned and decided that it was too risky to return Wilmore and Williams to Earth aboard Starliner.[17]The Boeing Starliner spacecraft returned uncrewed on September 6, 2024, and landed intact at White Sands Space Harbor, New Mexico at 12:01 a.m., September 7, after three months in space docked to the ISS. In December 2024, it was announced that Wilmore and Williams would return toEarthno earlier than late March 2025 on aSpaceXDragoncapsule.[5]
On January 30, 2025, Williams and Wilmore were scheduled to begin the station's 274th spacewalk, retrieving hardware from the exterior of the International Space Station.[18]
On March 18, 2025, Williams and Wilmore finally returned to Earth on theSpaceXDragoncapsule with the other crew members ofCrew-9.[4][5][19]
On August 6, 2025, NASA announced Wilmore's retirement from the agency.[2][20]
