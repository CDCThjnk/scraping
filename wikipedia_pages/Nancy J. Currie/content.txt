With NASA, she has participated in four space shuttle missions: STS-57, STS-70, STS-88, and STS-109, accruing 1,000 hours in space. She currently holds an appointment as a professor of practice in the Department of Industrial & Systems Engineering atTexas A&M University.

Background
Currie-Gregg was born Nancy Jane Decker[4]inWilmington, Delaware, on December 29, 1958. Her family moved toTroy, Ohiowhen she was young, and she considers Troy to be her hometown.[5]She graduated fromTroy High Schoolin 1977 and then received aBachelor of Artsdegree, with honors, inbiological sciencefromOhio State Universityin 1980, aMaster of Sciencedegree insafety engineeringfrom theUniversity of Southern Californiain 1985, and aDoctorateinindustrial engineeringfrom theUniversity of Houstonin 1997.[3]
Currie-Gregg is a member of the Army Aviation Association of America, Ohio State University andROTCAlumniAssociations,Institute of Industrial and Systems Engineers, andHuman Factors and Ergonomics Society,Association of Space Explorers. She is anassociate fellowof theAmerican Institute of Aeronautics and Astronautics.[3]

Military career
Currie-Gregg has served in theUnited States Armyfor over 23 years. Prior to her assignment atNASAin 1987, she attended initialrotary-wingpilottraining and was subsequently assigned as an instructor pilot at theU.S. Army Aviation School. She has served in a variety of leadership positions includingsection leader,platoon leader, and brigade flight-standardization officer. As aMaster Army Aviatorshe has logged over 3,900 flying hours in a variety of rotary-wing andfixed-wingaircraft.[3]

Astronaut career
Currie-Gregg was assigned to NASAJohnson Space Centerin September 1987 as a flight simulation engineer on theShuttle Training Aircraft, a complex airborne simulator which models flight characteristics of the Shuttle orbiter. Anastronautsince 1990, she has been involved inrobotichardware and procedure development for the shuttle andspace stationand has worked as a spacecraft communicator. Dr. Currie-Gregg has also served as the chief of the Astronaut Office Robotics and Payloads-Habitability branches and the Habitability and Human Factors Office in JSC's Space and Life Sciences Directorate. She has assisted the Johnson Space Center'sAutomation, Robotics, and Simulation Division in the development of advanced robotics systems and is a consultant to NASA's Space Human Factors Engineering Project. A veteran of fourSpace Shuttlemissions, she has accrued 1,000 hours in space. She flew as mission specialist –flight engineer, onSTS-57(1993),STS-70(1995),STS-88(1998; the firstInternational Space Stationassembly mission), andSTS-109(2002).[3]

STS-57
STS-57Endeavour(June 21 to July 1, 1993). The primary objective of this mission was the retrieval of the European Retrievable Carriersatellite(EURECA). Additionally, this mission featured the first flight of Spacehab, a commercially provided middeck augmentation module for the conduct ofmicrogravityexperiments, as well as aspacewalkby two crewmembers, during which Dr. Currie-Gregg operated the Shuttle's robotic arm. Spacehab carried 22 individual flight experiments in materials and life sciences research. STS-57 orbited the Earth 155 times and covered over 4.1 million miles in over 239 hours and 45 minutes.[3]

STS-70
STS-70Discovery(July 13–22, 1995). The five-member crew deployed the final NASA Tracking and Data Relay Satellite to complete theconstellationof NASA's orbitingcommunicationsatellite system. Dr. Currie-Gregg also conducted amyriadofbiomedicaland remote sensing experiments. STS-70 orbited the Earth 143 times and covered over 3.7 million miles in over 214 hours and 20 minutes.[3]

STS-88
STS-88Endeavour(December 4–15, 1998). STS-88, ISS Flight 2A was the first International Space Station assembly mission. The primary objective of this 12-day mission was to mate the first American-made module, Unity, to the first Russian-made module, Zarya. Dr. Currie-Gregg's primary role was to operate the Shuttle's 50-foot robotic arm to retrieve Zarya and connect the first two station segments. Two crewmembers performed a series of three spacewalks to connect electrical umbilicals and to attach hardware to the exterior structure for use during future EVAs. Dr. Currie-Gregg also operated the robot arm during the spacewalks. During the mission, the STS-88 crew ingressed the International Space Station to complete systems activation and installation of communication's equipment. The crew also deployed two small satellites. STS-88 completed 185 orbits of the Earth and covered over 4.7 million miles in 283 hours and 18 minutes.[3]

STS-109
STS-109Columbia(March 1–12, 2002). STS-109 was the fourth mission to service theHubble Space Telescope. During the flight, Dr. Currie-Gregg's primary role was to operate the Shuttle's 50-foot robot arm to retrieve and redeploy thetelescopefollowing the completion of numerous upgrades and repairs. She also operated the robot arm during a series of five consecutive spacewalks performed by four crewmembers. Hubble's scientific capabilities and power system were significantly upgraded with the replacement of both solar arrays and the primary power control unit, the installation of the AdvancedCamerafor Surveys, and a scientific instrument cooling system. The Hubble Space Telescope was then boosted to a higher orbit and redeployed to continue its mission of providing views of the universe which are unmatched by ground-based telescopes or other satellites. STS-109 completed 165 earth orbits and covered over 3.9 million miles in over 262 hours.[3]

Later life
In September 2003, after theSpace ShuttleColumbiadisaster, Currie-Gregg was selected to lead the Space Shuttle Program's Safety and Mission Assurance Office. She also served as the Senior Technical Advisor to the Automation, Robotics, and Simulation Division in theJohnson Space CenterEngineering Directorate,[3]NESC Chief Engineer at Johnson Space Center, and Principal Engineer in the NASA Engineering and Safety Center.[6]
Currie-Gregg previously held an appointment as adjunct associate professor inNorth Carolina State University's Department of Industrial Engineering.[6]She is currently a professor of practice in the Department of Industrial & Systems Engineering atTexas A&M University.[7]
Currie-Gregg developed a finite element human vibration model for use in spacecraft coupled loads analysis.[8]
At the 2022 Institute of Industrial and Systems Engineers (IISE) AppliedErgonomicsConference inOrlando, Currie-Gregg served as keynote speaker, discussing her career with both space travel and ergonomics. This was further detailed in the March 2023ISE Magazine, IISE's monthly publication.[9]

Personal life
Currie-Gregg has been married three times and has a child from her first marriage.[1]Her second husband, retired Army aviator andUnited Space Allianceemployee CW5 David Currie, died in 2011 from renal cancer.[10]
