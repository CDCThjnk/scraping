The seven-person crew also included two payload specialists: one from Canada, and one Navyoceanographer. During the mission, the crew deployed the ERBS satellite using theRemote Manipulator System(RMS), operated the OSTA-3 payload (including theSIR-Bradar, FILE, and MAPS experiments) and the Large Format Camera (LFC), conducted a satellite refueling demonstration usinghydrazinefuel with the Orbital Refueling System (ORS), and conducted numerous in-cabin experiments as well as activating eight "Getaway Special" canisters. Dave Leestma andKathryn Sullivansuccessfully conducted a 3½ hour extravehicular activity (EVA) to demonstrate the feasibility of actual satellite refueling.[6]

STS-45Atlantis, launched from the Kennedy Space Center, Florida on March 24, 1992. During the nine-day mission, the crew operated the twelve experiments that constituted the ATLAS-1 (Atmospheric Laboratory for Applications and Science) cargo. ATLAS-1 obtained a vast array of detailed measurements of atmospheric, chemical and physical properties, which will contribute significantly to improving our understanding of our climate and atmosphere. STS-45 landed on April 2, 1992, on Runway 33 at the Kennedy Space Center, Florida, after completing 142 orbits of the Earth.[7]
