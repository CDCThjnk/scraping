Scott David Tingle(born July 19, 1965) is aNASAastronaut.[1]He was selected in June 2009 as a member of theNASA Astronaut Group 20, qualifying in 2011. Serving as a flight engineer as part ofExpedition 54and55, Tingle launched into space on boardSoyuz MS-07in December 2017, and returned in June 2018.[2]Tingle is a highly decorated naval pilot, having flown 51 types of aircraft over more than 4,500 flight hours, landed 750 aircraft withcarrier arrestments, and fought in 54 combat missions.[3]

Early years and education
Scott Tingle is a captain in theU.S. Navy. He was born Scott D. Tingle inAttleboro, Massachusetts. Tingle became interested in space while working as a machine draftsman inBlue Hills Regional Technical School, class of 1983.[4]He continued to study mechanical engineering, earning a Bachelor of Science in Mechanical Engineering while attendingSoutheastern Massachusetts Universityin 1987, and a Master of Science in Mechanical Engineering fromPurdue Universityin 1988.[3][5]In 2009 his fourth application to the Astronaut Corps was accepted.

Military service
In 1991, Tingle was commissioned as anaval officer, and reported to NAS Pensacola, Florida for flight training. He was designated a Naval Aviator in 1993, and, after a period of instruction in the F/A-18, was subsequently assigned to VFA-146, based out of NAS Lemoore, California. With VFA-146, he deployed with Carrier Air Wing Nine aboard the USS Nimitz, and made deployments to the Western Pacific Ocean and Persian Gulf. In 1997, he was selected to attend theUnited States Naval Test Pilot School, and graduated in June 1998. Following graduation, he became an operational test pilot atChina Lake, Californiawith the Vampires ofVX-9. Following completion of his developmental test tour, Tingle completed aLanding Signal Officer"CAG Paddles" tour, flying F/A-18A/C Hornets alongsideCarrier Air Wing Eleven(CVW-11) aboard theUSSCarl Vinson. USSCarl Vinsonand Carrier Air Wing Eleven were the first air response to the September 11 attacks, and later assisted in the execution ofOperation Enduring Freedomin Afghanistan. Tingle then completed an assignment as an assistant operations officer with Strike Fighter Wing Pacific and briefly served as an instructor pilot withVFA-122. He later returned to Lemoore as a safety, maintenance, and operations officer department head withVFA-97. With VFA-97, he again deployed to the Western Pacific and Persian Gulf with CVW-11 before transferring toIwakuni, Japanwith Marine Air Group Twelve (MAG-12). In 2005, Tingle was assigned as the Ship Suitability Department Head atPatuxent River, Maryland, where he served as a test pilot withVX-23. At Patuxent River, Tingle tested theF/A-18C Hornet,FA-18E/F Super Hornet, andEA-18G Growleraircraft carrier precision landing systems. At the time of his selection as an astronaut, Tingle was working as a systems engineer and program manager on theStandoff Land Attack Missile(SLAM) and harpoon weapons systems atPMA-201.[3]

NASA career
In July 2009 Scott D. Tingle became a member of the20th astronaut class. His training consisted of flight familiarization withT-38's, spacewalks, technical training regarding the systems of The International space station andSoyuzdesigns, and standard wilderness survival training.
In 2014, Tingle served as cavenaut into theESA CAVES[6]training inSardinia, alongsideAlexander Misurkin,Sergey Kud-Sverchkov,Luca Parmitano, andMatthias Mauer.

Expedition 54/55
In May 2016 he was assigned to the crew of ISSExpedition 53/54, as flight engineer for both expeditions, alongside Russian cosmonautsAleksandr SkvortsovandIvan Vagner.[7]The trio was scheduled to launch in September 2017 aboardSoyuz MS-06. Although due to a Russian decision to reduce the number of crew members aboard theRussian Orbital Segmentuntil the launch of their long delayedNaukalaboratory module, Vagner was removed from Skvortosv and Tingle's crew. This resulted in Tingle being moved from the "Flight Engineer-2" position on the Soyuz to the much more systems intensive "Flight Engineer-1" position, this resulted in Tingle needing more time to train for his flight so he and Skvortsov were pushed back to ISS Expedition 54/55, they were joined byJAXAastronautNorishige Kanai. The ISS-54/55 crew changed one more time when Skvortsov was pushed back to a later flight due to a temporary medical condition and replaced with cosmonautAnton Shkaplerov.[8]
Shkaplerov, Tingle, and Kanai launched on boardSoyuz MS-07on 17 December 2017 07:21 UTC. Originally they were planned to rendezvous with the ISS in just six hours, although due to NASA wanting the launch to be advanced by ten days from December 27 the spacecraft was reverted to the older two-day rendezvous scheme. The three safely arrived aboard the ISS on December 19 and joined the Expedition 54 crew.[2]
On January 23, 2018, Tingle performed his first EVA withMark Vande Hei. The objective was to replace one of two redundant latching end effectors (LEE) onCanadarm2, the station's robotic arm, which had experienced some degradation of its snaring cables. The duration of the EVA was 7 hours and 24 minutes.[9]
Tingle and his two crewmates returned to Earth on June 3, 2018, following 168 days in space.[10]

Personal life
Scott Tingle is married to Raynette Mahelona Tingle and has three children. Although he was born in Attleboro, he considers his hometown to beRandolph, Massachusetts.[11]At age 15 he took guitar lessons from a neighbor, at age 16 he joined a band that he continued to play with through college, writing original music and playing at clubs inKenmore SquareandProvidence. Tingle cites his experience in a rock band as contributing to team skills he needed as an astronaut.[12]

Awards and honors
Through his educational, military, and NASA career, Tingle has received many awards and honors. He graduated magna cum laude from Southeastern Massachusetts University, earned Outstanding Graduate ofU.S. Navy Test Pilot SchoolClass 113, and was awardedMeritorious ServiceMedal, threeAir Medals, sixNavy CommendationMedals, fourNavy and Marine Corps AchievementMedals, and aCombat Vmedal.[3]
