Edgar Dean "Ed" Mitchell(September 17, 1930 – February 4, 2016) was aUnited States Navyofficer andaviator,test pilot,aeronautical engineer,ufologist, andNASAastronaut. As theLunar ModulePilot ofApollo 14in 1971 he spent nine hours working on the lunar surface in theFra Mauro Highlands region, and was the sixthperson to walk on the Moon. He was the secondFreemasonto set foot on the Moon, afterBuzz Aldrin.
Before becoming an astronaut, Mitchell earned hisBachelor of Sciencedegree inIndustrial ManagementfromCarnegie Institute of Technologyand entered theUnited States Navyin 1952. After being commissioned through theOfficer Candidate SchoolatNewport, Rhode Island, he served as aNaval Aviator. In 1961, he received his secondbachelor's degree, inaeronautical engineering, from the U.S.Naval Postgraduate Schooland three years later earned hisdoctorateinAeronauticsandAstronauticsfrom theMassachusetts Institute of Technology(MIT). From 1965 to 1966, he attended theU.S. Air Force Aerospace Research Pilot Schooland graduated first in his class. During this period, he served as aninstructorin advancedmathematicsandnavigation theoryfor astronaut candidates.
The legacy of his post-NASA scientific and parapsychology work is carried on through theInstitute of Noetic Sciences.[1]

Early life and education
Mitchell was born on September 17, 1930, inHereford, Texas, to Joseph Thomas Mitchell (1910–1967) and Ollidean Margaret Mitchell (néeArnold; 1911–1977).[2]He had three siblings: Joyce Alyene, who died in her infancy in 1933, Sandra Jo (1934–1988) and Jay Neely "Coach" (1937–2013), who was a member of the inaugural graduating class of theUnited States Air Force Academyin 1959, and apilotwith theUnited States Air Force(USAF), achieving the rank ofcolonel. He came from aranchingfamily that moved to New Mexico during theDepressionand consideredArtesia, New Mexico(nearRoswell)[3]as his hometown. He first learned to fly at 13,[4]receiving hisprivate pilot licenseat 16, and was active in theBoy Scouts of Americawhere he achieved its second highest rank,Life Scout.[5]He was also a member ofDeMolay International, part of theMasonic Fraternity, and was inducted into its Hall of Fame. Mitchell was a member of Artesia Lodge #29 inNew Mexico.[6]He enjoyedhandball,tennis, andswimming, and his hobbies includedscuba divingandsoaring.
He graduated fromArtesia High Schoolin 1948. Mitchell received aBachelor of Sciencedegree inindustrial managementfrom theCarnegie Institute of Technology(now Carnegie Mellon University) in 1952, where he was a member ofKappa Sigmafraternity.[7]That same year, he entered theUnited States Navyand completedbasic trainingatSan Diego Recruit Depot.[8]While on active duty in the Navy, he earned a secondbachelor's degree, inaeronautical engineering, from the U.S.Naval Postgraduate Schoolin 1961 and aDoctor of Sciencedegree inaeronauticsandastronauticsfrom theMassachusetts Institute of Technology(MIT) in 1964.[9][7]

Flight experience
In May 1953, after completing instruction at theOfficer Candidate SchoolatNewport, Rhode Island, Mitchell was commissioned anEnsign. He completed flight training in July 1954 atHutchinson, Kansas, was designated as aNaval Aviatorand received theDaughters of the American Revolution Awardfor achieving the highest overall marks during flight training. After period of instruction from July to September 1954 at the Fleet Airborne Electronics Training Unit,U.S. Pacific Fleet, Mitchell was subsequently assigned to Patrol Squadron 29 (VP-29), flying land-based patrol planes, deployed toOkinawa.[10][11]
From 1957 to 1958, Mitchell transitioned to carrier-based jet aircraft and flew theA3D Skywarriorwhile assigned to Heavy Attack Squadron Two (VAH-2) deployed aboard theaircraft carriersUSSBon Homme RichardandUSSTiconderoga. He qualified as a research pilot and flew withAir Development Squadron Fiveuntil 1959. Following the completion of his graduate studies, Mitchell served as Chief, Project Management Division of the Navy Field Office for theManned Orbiting Laboratoryfrom 1964 to 1965. From 1965 to 1966, he attended theU.S. Air Force Aerospace Research Pilot Schoolfor certification as atest pilot, graduating first in his class. During this period, Mitchell served as aninstructorin advancedmathematicsandnavigation theoryfor astronaut candidates.[10]
Mitchell accumulated 5,000 hours flight time, including 2,000 hours injet aircraft.[12]

NASA career
Mitchell was selected in 1966 as part ofNASA's fifth astronaut group.[13]He was assigned to the support crew forApollo 9, then was designated as backupLunar ModulePilot forApollo 10. This placed him in rotation for Apollo 13, but his crew was switched to Apollo 14 so that CommanderAlan Shepard, who had been grounded by amedical problemsince theGemini program, could train longer.[14]
During theApollo 13crisis, Mitchell was a part of theApollo 13 Mission Operations Teamand as such was awarded thePresidential Medal of Freedomby PresidentRichard M. Nixonin 1970. He worked in an Apollo simulator to help bring the crew back. One issue he worked on was how to "fly" (meaningcontrol the attitude of) the Lunar Module with an inertApollo Command/Service Moduleattached to it. (Usually, it was the other way around, but the Service Module was damaged during that mission.)[14]
He then went to serve as Lunar Module Pilot on Apollo 14, landing with Shepard aboard the Lunar ModuleAntareson February 5, 1971, in the hilly uplandFra Mauro Highlandsregion of the Moon. They stayed on the Moon for 33 hours, deployed and activatedlunar surfacescientific equipment and experiments, and collected almost 100 pounds of lunar samples for return to Earth. Other Apollo 14 achievements include: only use of the Mobile Equipment Transporter (MET); first successful use of color television with a newVidicontube; longest distance traversed on foot on the lunar surface;[15]largest payload placed in lunar orbit; first use of shortened lunar orbitrendezvoustechniques; and first extensive orbital science period conducted during CSM solo operations.[10]
In completing his first space flight, Mitchell logged a total of 216 hours and 42 minutes in space. He was subsequently designated to serve as backup Lunar Module Pilot forApollo 16.
During the mission, he took photos, including the one with Shepard raising the American flag. In the photo, Mitchell's shadow is cast over the lunar surface near the flag. That photo was listed onPopular Science's photo gallery of the bestastronaut selfies.[16]
You develop an instant global consciousness, a people orientation, an intense dissatisfaction with the state of the world, and a compulsion to do something about it. From out there on the moon, international politics look so petty. You want to grab a politician by the scruff of the neck and drag him a quarter of a million miles out and say, "Look at that, you son of a bitch."
— Mitchell on theoverview effectafter seeing the Earth from the Moon.[17]

Post-NASA career
Mitchell's interests included consciousness andparanormalphenomena. On his way back to Earth during the Apollo 14 flight he had a powerfulsavikalpa samādhiexperience,[18]and he claimed to have conducted privateESPexperiments with his friends on Earth.[19]The results of these experiments were published in theJournal of Parapsychologyin 1971.[20]
He retired from NASA and the U.S. Navy with the rank ofcaptainin October 1972.[10]Immediately thereafter, he founded Edgar D. Mitchell & Associates ofMonterey, California, a "commercial organization promoting ecologically-pure products and services designed to alleviate planetary problems."[21]
After moving toAtherton, California, he became founding chairman of theInstitute of Noetic Sciences(IONS) inPalo Alto, Californiain 1973 for the purpose ofconsciousnessresearch and other "related phenomena".[22][15]"Science and religion have lived on opposite sides of the street now for hundreds of years," Mitchell said toward the end of his life. "So here we are, in the twenty-first century, trying to put two faces of reality—the existence face and the intelligence or conscious face—into the same understanding. Body and mind, physicality and consciousness belong to the same side of reality.[23]
JournalistAnnie Jacobsenhas asserted that Mitchell's Mind Science Institute (aLos Angeles, California-based organization ultimately subsumed by the Institute of Noetic Sciences) was employed by theCentral Intelligence Agency(CIA) as a surreptitious conduit for payments toAndrija PuharichandUri Gellerwhile the latter was evaluated by anSRI Internationalresearch group (led byHarold E. PuthoffandRussell Targ) in 1972.[24]In 1976, Mitchell attempted to secure additional funding for the SRI group'sremote viewingresearch in a private meeting with then-Director of Central IntelligenceGeorge H. W. Bush, who knew Mitchell socially. Although Bush demurred (citing post-Watergateinvestigations of the intelligence community), he suggested the pursuit of military sponsorship, leading to the formation of theStargate Projectin 1978.[25]
From 1974 to 1978, he was president of thePalm Beach, Florida-based Edgar Mitchell Corporation. In 1975, he moved to nearbyLantana, Florida, where he resided for the rest of his life.[10]He co-founded theAssociation of Space Explorersin 1983 and later served as chairman of the Mitchell Communications Company.[15][26]
Mitchell's heretofore undisclosed experimentation withLSDwas reported by writerDavid Jay BrowninThe New Science of Psychedelics: At the Nexus of Culture, Consciousness, and Spirituality(2013). Although he favorably compared the sensations of thepsychedelic experienceto his time in zero gravity, it remains unclear if his use preceded or followed Apollo 14.[27]
In 1997, Mitchell was interviewed for NASA's oral history program.[15]In one excerpt from that, he talked about how he was drawn to the space program:[15]
After Kennedy announced the moon program, that's what I wanted, because it was the bear going over the mountain to see what he could see, and what could you learn, and I've been devoted to that, to exploration, education, and discovery since my earliest years, and that's what kept me going.
— Edgar Mitchell[15]
On June 29, 2011, thefederal government of the United Statesfiled a lawsuit against Mitchell in theUnited States district courtinMiami,Floridaafter discovering that he placed a camera used on Apollo 14 for auction at the auction houseBonhams. The litigation requested the camera be returned to NASA. Mitchell's position was that NASA had given him the camera as a gift upon the completion of the Apollo 14 mission. Bonhams withdrew the camera from auction.[28]In October 2011, attorneys representing the government and Mitchell reached a settlement agreement, and Mitchell agreed to return the camera to NASA, which in turn would donate it for display at theNational Air and Space Museum.[29]On September 20, 2012, Congress enacted H.R. 4158, confirming full ownership rights of artifacts to astronauts onApollo(andMercuryandGemini) space missions.

Remote healing
Mitchell claimed that a teenage remotehealerliving inVancouverand using the pseudonym "Adam Dreamhealer" helped him healkidney cancerfrom a distance. Mitchell said that while he never had abiopsy, "I had a sonogram and MRI that was consistent with renalcarcinoma." Adam worked (distantly) on Mitchell from December 2003 until June 2004, when the "irregularity was gone and we haven't seen it since".[30]

Views on UFOs
Mitchell publicly expressed his opinions that he was "90 percent sure that many of the thousands ofunidentified flying objects, or UFOs, recorded since the 1940s, belong to visitors from other planets".[31]Dateline NBCconducted an interview with Mitchell on April 19, 1996, during which he discussed meeting with officials from three countries who claimed to have had personal encounters with extraterrestrials. He offered his opinion that the evidence for such "alien" contact was "very strong" and "classified" by governments, who were covering up visitations and the existence of alien beings' bodies in places such as Roswell, New Mexico. He further claimed that UFOs had provided "sonic engineering secrets" that were helpful to the U.S. government. Mitchell's 1996 book,The Way of the Explorer, discusses his journey into mysticism and space.[32]
In 2004, he told theSt. Petersburg Timesthat a "cabal of insiders" in the U.S. government were studying recovered alien bodies, and that this group had stopped briefing U.S. Presidents afterJohn F. Kennedy.[33]He said, "We all know that UFOs are real; now the question is where they come from."[34]
On July 23, 2008, Edgar Mitchell was interviewed onKerrang RadiobyNick Margerrison. Mitchell claimed theRoswell crashwas real and thatalienshave contacted humans several times, but that governments have hidden the truth for 60 years, stating: "I happen to have been privileged enough to be in on the fact that we've been visited on this planet, and the UFO phenomenon is real." In reply, a spokesman forNASAstated on the Skeptoid Podcast withBrian Dunning: "NASA does not track UFOs. NASA is not involved in any sort of cover-up about alien life on this planet or anywhere in the universe. Dr Mitchell is a great American, but we do not share his opinions on this issue."[35]
In an interview withFox Newson July 25, 2008, Mitchell clarified that his comments did not involve NASA, but quoted unnamed sources, since deceased, atRoswellwho confided to him that the Roswell incident did involve an alien craft. Mitchell also claims to have subsequently received confirmation from an unnamed intelligence officer atthe Pentagon.[36][37]
In an interview forAskMenpublished March 6, 2014, Mitchell said that he had never seen a UFO,[35]that no one had ever threatened him over his claims regarding UFOs, and that any statements about the covering up of UFOs being a worldwide cabal was "just speculation on my part".[38]
In 2015, Mitchell said in an interview with theDaily Mirrorthat extraterrestrials "had been attempting to keep us from going to war [with Russia] and help create peace on Earth." He also said that "White Sands was a testing ground for atomic weapons—and that's what the extraterrestrials were interested in. They wanted to know about our military capabilities."[39]

Other projects
Edgar Mitchell appeared in the documentariesIn the Shadow of the Moon(2007),The Phoenix Lights...We Are Not Alone, andThe Living Matrix(2009).
Mitchell wrote several articles and essays as well as several books. InThe Way of the Explorer, Mitchell proposed adyadicmodel of reality.[40]
He was theAdvisory BoardChairmanof the Institute for Cooperation in Space, co-founded byCarol Rosin,[41]and a member ofINREES[fr].
Mitchell was one of the initial supporters of the Campaign for the Establishment of aUnited Nations Parliamentary Assembly, which would be a first step towards a "world parliament".[42]

Personal life
He was married to Louise Randall from 1951 to 1972. Following their divorce, he married Anita Rettig in 1973. The couple divorced in 1984 when he began an affair with formerPlayboymodel Sheilah Ann Ledbetter.[43]He was father to two children with Randall, adopted Rettig's three children, and later was father to another child, this time with Ledbetter, and ordered to pay child support.[44][45][46]Ledbetter and Mitchell married in 1989 and divorced in 1999.[47][48]He was survived by five children, nine grandchildren and one great-grandchild.
Anita Rettig served as chair of thePalm Beach CountyRepublican Party, while Kimberly Mitchell (the eldest daughter from his union with Rettig) was a city commissioner inWest Palm Beach, Florida.[47]

Death
Mitchell died underhospicecare inWest Palm Beach, Florida, at the age of 85, on February 4, 2016,[48][49]the eve of the 45th anniversary of his lunar landing.[15]As Roosa and Shepard had died in the 1990s, Mitchell was the last surviving member of the Apollo 14 crew.[14]
