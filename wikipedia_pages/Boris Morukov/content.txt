Biography
Morukov graduated from high school in 1967 and received hisM.D.from the 2nd Moscow Medical Institute (nowRussian State Medical University) in 1973.

From 1982 to 1987, Morukov coordinated scientific projects dedicated to the development of countermeasures to the negative metabolic changes that occur duringhypokinesiaandmicrogravity. His specific scientific interest in this area iscalcium metabolism correction. He organized a series of experiments with prolonged head-down tilt, including a 370-day experiment dedicated to the experimental testing of a countermeasure complex for prolonged space flights. He participated in a joint American-Russian medical experiment onSTS-60,Mir 18/STS-71and all other Mir-NASAProject Missions. From 1995 to 1998 he served as the Human Life-Sciences Experiments Coordinator for the NASA-Mir scientific program.

The five astronauts and two cosmonauts delivered more than 6,600 pounds of supplies and installedbatteries, power converters, atoiletand a treadmill on the Space Station. Two crew members performed a space walk in order to connect power, data and communications cables to the newly arrivedZvezda Service Moduleand the Space Station. Morukov logged 11 days, 19 hours, and 10 minutes in space.
