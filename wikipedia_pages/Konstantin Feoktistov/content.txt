As a cosmonaut Feoktistov flew onVoskhod 1, the first spacecraft to carry three crew members.[a]Feoktistov also wrote several books on space technology and exploration. TheFeoktistov crateron the far side of theMoonis named in his honor.

Biography
During the Nazi occupation ofVoronezh, at the age of just 16, Feoktistov fought with theSoviet Armyagainst theGerman troops, carrying outreconnaissancemissions for theVoronezh Front.[1][2]After being captured by aWaffen-SSArmy patrol, Feoktistov was shot by a German officer. However, the bullet went right through his chin and neck and did not kill him. Feoktistov could crawl out later and then make his way to the Soviet lines.
After the war was over, Feoktistov enrolled in theBauman Moscow Higher Technical Schoolas an engineering student and he graduated in 1949. Feoktistov also later earned a doctorate inphysics. He joinedMikhail Tikhonravov'sOKB(design bureau), and in 1955, Feoktistov formed part of the team that went on to design theSputniksatellites, theVostok space capsule, theVoskhod space capsule, and theSoyuz space capsuleunder the leadership of the Soviet Chief DesignerSergey Korolev. During this time, Feoktistov also worked on a design for anion-propelledspacecraft capable of taking humans toMars.
In 1964, Feoktistov was selected as part of a group of engineers forcosmonauttraining, and in October of that same year, he was hastily assigned to the multi-disciplinary Voskhod 1 crew. He was the first civilian to make a space flight, and the only cosmonaut in the Soviet Union who was not a member of theCommunist Party of the Soviet Union.[3]He spent just over 24 hours and 17 minutes in space during his space flight.[4]
After the flight of Voskhod 1, Feoktistov's training for any furtherspace missionwas discontinued for medical reasons. However, Feoktistov continued his outer space engineering work, and he later became the head of the Soviet space design bureau that designed theSalyutandMirspace stations.
In October 1969, Konstantin Feoktistov and Georgi Beregovoi traveled as guests of NASA throughout the US, visiting any city they chose andDisneylandin California – they were joined on the trip by US astronauts as hosts, includingEugene Cernan,Neil Armstrongand others.Kirk Douglasand others hosted receptions for them in Hollywood – they were protected by special agents of the US State Department on request of NASA.  Almost every place they went when accompanied by Eugene Cernan, if a band was present  the song "Fly Me to the Moon" was played – when they visited Disneyland they enjoyed the ride Trip To The Moon, then joked with the US astronauts that they went to Disneyland and not the Moon.  It was a trip that all enjoyed and international friendships were made.
Feoktistov resigned from his engineering position withEnergiaand then returned to Bauman Moscow Higher Technical School as a professor in 1990.

Note
 - ^Voskhod 1 was also the first spacecraft to carrymore than onecrew member, preceding the two-man flights of the AmericanGemini Program.  Despite this, Voskhod 1 did not represent the first time that more than one human had been in space at the same time. Thisfirst occurredwhenAndriyan NikolayevandPavel Popovichsimultaneously orbited Earth in separate spacecraft—Vostok 3andVostok 4, respectively.
