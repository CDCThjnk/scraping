Fincke spent six months aboard the ISS continuing ISS science operations, maintaining station systems, and performing four spacewalks. Expedition 9 concluded with undocking from the station and safe landing back in Kazakhstan on October 23, 2004. Fincke completed his first mission in 187 days, 21 hours, and 17 minutes, and logged a total of 15 hours, 45 minutes, and 22 seconds of EVA time in four spacewalks.

He arrived at the International Space Station aboard the Soyuz TMA-13 on October 14, 2008 with cosmonaut Yuri Lonchakov and space flight participant Richard Garriott . While Richard Garriott was aboard, Fincke participated during his personal time (along with Yury Lonchakov, Gregory Chamitoff , and Richard Garriott) in filming and starring in a science-fiction movie made in space, Apogee of Fear . On April 8, 2009, Fincke, Lonchakov, and space tourist Charles Simonyi returned to Earth aboard the TMA-13.
- Replacing Fincke as commander of the space station was Gennady Padalka , whom he served with on Expedition 9.
- Fincke was a mission specialist on STS-134 , which was his only flight on the Space Shuttle . Fincke made three spacewalks during the mission.
