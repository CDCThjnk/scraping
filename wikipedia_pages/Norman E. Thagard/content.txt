Norman Earl Thagard(born July 3, 1943;Capt,USMC, Ret.) is an Americanscientistand formerU.S. Marine Corps officerandnaval aviatorandNASAastronaut. He is a veteran of five space flights and on March 14, 1995, he became the first American to ride tospaceon board a Russian vehicle, theSoyuz TM-21spacecraft for the RussianMir-18mission.

Personal life
Thagard was born July 3, 1943, inMarianna, Florida, but considersJacksonville, Florida, to be his hometown. He is married to Rex Kirby Johnson, formerly of South Ponte Vedra Beach, Florida. They have three sons. His father, Mr. James E. Thagard, and his mother, Mrs. Mary F. Key, are both deceased. During his free time, he enjoysclassical musicandelectronic design.[1]Thagard has published articles on digital and analog electronic design.[2]

Education and military service
Thagard earned a Bachelors and Masters Degrees in Engineering Science from Florida State University in Tallahassee by 1966.[3]
In September 1966 he enteredactive dutywith theUnited States Marine Corps Reserve. He achieved the rank ofcaptainin 1967, was designated aNaval Aviatorin 1968 and was subsequently assigned to duty flyingF-4 Phantom IIswithVMFA-333atMarine Corps Air Station Beaufort,South Carolina. He flew 163combat missionsinVietnamwhile assigned toVMFA-115from January 1969 to 1970. He returned to the United States and an assignment as aviation weapons division officer withVMFA-251at the Marine Corps Air Station at Beaufort, South Carolina. He is a pilot and has logged more than 2,200 hours flying time, of which the majority was injet aircraft.[1]
Thagard resumed his academic studies in 1971, pursuing additional studies inElectrical Engineeringandmedicine. In 1977, he earned a Doctor of Medicine degree from the University of Texas Southwestern Medical School.[3]Before joining NASA, he was interning in the Department of Internal Medicine at theMedical University of South Carolina. He is a licensedphysician.

NASA career
Thagard was selected as an astronaut candidate by NASA in January 1978.[3]In August 1979, he completed a one-year training and evaluation period, making him eligible for assignment as amission specialiston futureSpace Shuttleflights. A veteran of five space flights, he logged over 140 days in space. He was a mission specialist onSTS-7in 1983,STS-51-Bin 1985,STS-30in 1989, was the payload commander onSTS-42in 1992, and was the cosmonaut/researcher on the RussianMir EO-18mission in 1995, which saw him launch aboardSoyuz TM-21(the first American to launch in a Soyuz) and land onSTS-71.
Thagard first flew on the crew of STS-7, which launched fromKennedy Space Center, Florida, on June 18, 1983. This was the second flight for the OrbiterChallengerand the first mission with a crew of five. During the mission, the STS-7 crew deployed satellites for Canada (ANIK C-2) andIndonesia(Palapa B1); operated the Canadian-built Remote Manipulator System (RMS) to perform the first deployment and retrieval exercise with theShuttle Pallet Satellite(SPAS-01); conducted the first formation flying of the Orbiter with a free-flying satellite (SPAS-01); carried and operated the first U.S./German cooperative materials science payload (OSTA-2); and operated the Continuous Flow Electrophoresis System (CFES) and the Monodisperse Latex Reactor (MLR) experiments, in addition to activating seven "Getaway Specials." During the flight, Thagard conducted various medical tests and collected data on physiological changes associated with astronaut adaptation to space. He also retrieved the rotating SPAS-01 using the RMS. Mission duration was 147 hours before landing atEdwards Air Force Base,California, on June 24, 1983.[4]
Thagard then flew onSTS-51-B, the Spacelab-3 science mission, which launched from Kennedy Space Center, Florida, on April 29, 1985, aboardChallenger. During the mission he served as flight engineer, sitting on the flight deck and assisting the commander and pilot during ascent and entry. Mission duration was 168 hours. Duties on orbit included satellite deployment operation with the NUSAT satellite as well as animal care for the 24 rats and two squirrel monkeys contained in the Research Animal Holding Facility (RAHF). Other duties were operation of the Geophysical Fluid Flow Cell (GFFC), Urinary Monitoring System (UMS) and the Ionization States of Solar and Galactic Cosmic Ray Heavy Nuclei (IONS) experiment. After 110 orbits of theEarth,Challengerlanded at Edwards Air Force Base, California, on May 6, 1985.[5]
He next served on the crew ofSTS-30, which launched from Kennedy Space Center, Florida, on May 4, 1989, aboard the OrbiterAtlantis. Thagard again served as flight engineer. During this four-day mission, crew members deployed theMagellanVenus-exploration spacecraft, the first U.S. planetary science mission launched since 1978, and the first planetary probe to be deployed from the Shuttle.Magellanarrived at Venus in mid-1990 and mapped the entire surface of Venus using specialized radar instruments. In addition, crew members also worked on secondary payloads involving fluid research in general, chemistry and electrical storm studies. Mission duration was 97 hours. Following 64 orbits of the Earth, the STS-30 mission concluded with a landing at Edwards Air Force Base, California, on May 8, 1989.[6]
Thagard served as payload commander onSTS-42, aboard the orbiterDiscovery, which lifted off from the Kennedy Space Center, Florida, on January 22, 1992. Fifty five major experiments conducted in the International Microgravity Laboratory-1 module were provided by investigators from eleven countries, and represented a broad spectrum of scientific disciplines. During 128 orbits of the Earth, theSTS-42crew accomplished the mission's primary objective of investigating the effects of microgravity on materials processing and life sciences. In this unique laboratory in space, crew members worked around-the-clock in two shifts. Experiments investigated the microgravity effects on the growth of protein and semiconductor crystals. Biological experiments on the effects of zero gravity on plants, tissues, bacteria, insects and human vestibular response were also conducted. This eight-day mission culminated in a landing at Edwards Air Force Base, California, on January 30, 1992.[7]
On his last mission, Thagard was a crew member for the Russian Mir EO-18 mission. Twenty-eight experiments were conducted in the course of the 115-day flight. The crew lifted off from theBaikonur CosmodromeinKazakhstanaboardSoyuz TM-21on March 14, 1995. The mission culminated in a landing at the Kennedy Space Center on the Space ShuttleAtlantisflightSTS-71on July 7, 1995.[1]

Post-NASA career
Thagard retired from NASA in December 1995[1]and joined the faculty of Florida State University at Tallahassee.[8]He became a tenured professor and associate dean for college relations in theFAMU - FSU College of Engineering.[9]
In 1996, at the request of theSmithsonian Institution, Thagard's Russian "SOKOL" space suit was donated to the National Air & Space Museum[10]Norman Thagard also served as an aerospaceconsultantand wastechnical advisorforVirus,a 1999 film starringJamie Lee CurtisandDonald Sutherland,[11]and forArmageddon(1998) starringBruce Willis,Ben Affleck, andLiv Tyler.[12]
In 1998, Norm Thagard was appointed to theBoard of Directorsof EMS Technologies, Inc. EMS is anAtlanta-based communications company.[13]
In 2003, Thagard co-founded the Challenger Learning Center of Tallahassee, with shuttle/mission control/space station simulators, digital space theater/planetarium andIMAXtheater. Thagard's interest in part was driven by his close friendship with the family of Challenger astronaut Dick Scobee.[14]He also serves as an advisor for Space Adventures, Ltd., a company offering aerospace experiences, including orbital flight.[15]
In 2009, Thagard was elected Fellow of the American Institute of Aeronautics and Astronautics.[16]He was also a member of the Editorial Review Board of theJournal of the Society for Human Performance in Extreme Environments.
