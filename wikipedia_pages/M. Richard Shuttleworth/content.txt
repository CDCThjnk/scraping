Mark Richard Shuttleworth(born 18 September 1973) is a South African and British entrepreneur, founder and CEO ofCanonical, the company behind theUbuntuLinux operating system.[1]In 2002, Shuttleworth became the first African to travel to space, doing so as aspace tourist.[2][3][4]He holdsdual citizenshipfrom South Africa and theUnited Kingdom.[5][6]As of 2020, theSunday Times Rich Listestimated Shuttleworth's worth at £500 million.[7]

Early life
Shuttleworth was born inWelkom,Free State, South Africa, to a surgeon and a nursery-school teacher.[8]He attended Western Province Preparatory School (where he became Head Boy in 1986), followed by one term atRondebosch Boys' High School, and then Bishops/Diocesan Collegewhere he was Head Boy in 1991.[9][10]Shuttleworth obtained aBachelor of Business Sciencedegree inFinanceandInformation Systemsat theUniversity of Cape Town. As a student, he was involved in the installation of the university's first residential Internet connections.[11]

Work
In 1995, Shuttleworth foundedThawte Consulting, a company specializing indigital certificatesandInternet security. According to The Official Ubuntu Book, Thawte became the second-largestcertificate authorityafterVeriSign. Shuttleworth sold Thawte to VeriSign in December 1999,[12]earning himR3.5 billion (US$575million, equivalent to$989 million in 2023).[13]
In September 2000, Shuttleworth formed HBD Venture Capital (Here be Dragons), abusiness incubatorandventure capitalprovider, now managed by Knife Capital.[14]In March 2004 he formed Canonical Ltd., for the promotion and commercial support offree softwareprojects, particularly theUbuntuoperating system. In December 2009, Shuttleworth stepped down as CEO of Canonical Ltd. to focus on "product design, partnerships, and customers", with COOJane Silbersucceeding him.[15]Shuttleworth returned to the position of CEO of Canonical in July 2017, with Silber moving to Canonical'sboard of directors.[16]

Linux and FOSS
In the 1990s, Shuttleworth participated as a developer of theDebianoperating system.[17]According to the Official Ubuntu Book, he was the first to upload theApache HTTP Server"into the Debian project's archives".[12]
In 2001, he formed theShuttleworth Foundation, a nonprofit organisation dedicated to social innovation and funding educational, free, andopen source softwareprojects in South Africa, such as theFreedom Toaster.[18]
In 2004, he returned to the free-software world by funding the development ofUbuntu, aLinux distributionbased on Debian, through his company, Canonical Ltd.[18]
In 2005, he founded the Ubuntu Foundation and made an initial investment of US$10 million. In the Ubuntu project, Shuttleworth is often referred to with thetongue-in-cheektitle "Self-AppointedBenevolent Dictator for Life" (SABDFL).[19]While travelling toAntarcticaaboard theicebreakerKapitan Khlebnikovin early 2004, Shuttleworth took six months of Debianmailing listarchives with him to compile a list of potential hires for the project.[20]In September 2005, he purchased a 65% stake of Impi Linux.[21]
On 15 October 2006, Mark Shuttleworth became the first patron ofKDE, the highest level of commercial sponsorship available.[22]This relationship and financial support forKubuntu(the Ubuntu variant usingKDEas the main desktop) ended in 2012.
On 17 December 2009, Shuttleworth announced that, effective March 2010, he would step down as CEO of Canonical to focus on product design, partnerships, and customers.Jane Silber, COO since 2004, succeeded him as CEO.[23]
In September 2010, he received an honorary degree from theOpen Universityfor this work.[24]
On 9 November 2012, Shuttleworth andKenneth RogoffdebatedGarry KasparovandPeter Thielat theOxford Unionin adebateentitled "The Innovation Enigma".[25]
On 25 October 2013, Shuttleworth and Ubuntu received the Austrian anti-privacyBig Brother Awardfor sending local UbuntuUnity Dashsearches to Canonical servers by default.[26][27][28][29]In 2012, Shuttleworth had defended the anonymisation method used.[30]He later reversed the decision; this feature is not present in current Ubuntu versions.

Spaceflight
Shuttleworth gained international attention on 25 April 2002, becoming the second self-funded space tourist (afterDennis Titoin 2001) and the first South African in space.[a]Flying throughSpace Adventures, he launched aboard the RussianSoyuz TM-34mission as aspaceflight participant,[31]paying approximately US$20 million[32]for the voyage (equivalent to $32.39 million in 2023). Two days later, theSoyuz spacecraftarrived at theInternational Space Station, where he spent eight days participating in experiments related toAIDSandgenomeresearch. On 5 May 2002, he returned to Earth onSoyuz TM-33. To participate in the flight, Shuttleworth underwent one year of training and preparation, including seven months inStar City, Russia.[33]
From space, he spoke via video link toThabo Mbeki, then president of South Africa, as part of theFreedom Daycelebrations marking the end ofapartheid.[34]
He also had a radio conversation withNelson Mandelaand a 14-year-old South African girl, Michelle Foster, who asked him to marry her. He dodged the question, stating that he was "very honoured at the question" before changing the subject.[32]The terminally ill Foster was provided the opportunity to have a conversation with Mark Shuttleworth and Nelson Mandela by the Reach for a Dream foundation.[35][36]

Transport
He owns a private jet, aBombardier Global Express, often referred to asCanonical Onebut owned through his HBD Venture Capital company.[37][38][39]The dragon depicted on the side of the plane is Norman, the HBD Venture Capital mascot.[40]

Legal clash with the South African Reserve Bank
When moving R2.5 billion in capital from South Africa to theIsle of Man, theSouth African Reserve Bankimposed a R250 million levy to release his assets.[41]Shuttleworth successfully sued the Reserve Bank in the Supreme Court of Appeal to have the levy returned. However, on 18 June 2015, theConstitutional Court of South Africareversed the lower courts' ruling, finding that the primary purpose of an exit charge was to regulate conduct rather than raise revenue.[42]The court held "...that the exit charge was not inconsistent with the Constitution. The dominant purpose of the exit charge was not to raise revenue but rather to regulate conduct by discouraging the export of capital to protect the domestic economy."[43]

Notes
 - ^Shuttleworth is the first citizen of an independent African country to go into space.Patrick Baudry, an earlier astronaut, was also born in Africa; however, since Baudry's native Cameroon was a Frenchcolonyat the time of his birth, he is considered a French citizen. Shuttleworth also had British citizenship at the time of his flight.
