Igor Petrovich Volk(Russian:Игорь Петрович Волк,Ukrainian:Ігор Петрович Волк; 12 April 1937 – 3 January 2017) was a Russiantest pilotand former Sovietcosmonautin theBuran programme.

Military and test pilot
Volk became a pilot in theSoviet Air Forcesin 1956. After graduation from theFedotov Test Pilot Schoolin 1965, he has joined theGromov Flight Research Institute.[1][2]He logged over 7000 flight hours in over 80 different aircraft types. Over the years, he flew on all types of Soviet fighters, bombers, and transport aircraft. He showed outstanding abilities in complex tests of various airplanes at critical angles of attack, stall, and spin. He was the first who tested aircraft behavior at high super-critical angles of attack (around 90°) and performed aerobatics such as the "cobra" maneuver.[3]

Space program
Igor Volk was selected as a cosmonaut on 12 July 1977 and subsequently assigned to theBuran programme. As part of his preparations for aspace shuttleflight, he also accomplished test-flights with Buran's counterpartOK-GLIaircraft.
In July 1984, Volk flew aboardSoyuz T-12, intended to give him some experience in space. With Volks's participation as research cosmonaut on the 7th expedition toSalyut 7, one goal of the mission was to evaluate the effects of long-duration spaceflight on a pilot's skills and ability to fly and land an aeroplane safely (in order to prove Volk's ability to controlSpace Shuttle Buranatmospheric segment of flight).[3]At the time of the Soyuz T-12 mission, the Buran program was still a state secret. The appearance of Volk as a crew member caused some, including theBritish Interplanetary SocietymagazineSpaceflight, to ask why a test pilot was occupying a Soyuz seat usually reserved for researchers or foreign cosmonauts.[4]
After his orbital flight, Volk served as the head of pilot-cosmonaut training department for the Buran program and later (after the project's cancellation) worked for theGromov Flight Research Instituteas a Flight Tests Deputy Chief before retiring in 1996. He previously served as President of theNational Aero Club of Russiaand Vice President of theFédération Aéronautique Internationale. As recognition for his contributions as a test pilot and cosmonaut he was awarded theHero of the Soviet Unionon 29 July 1984.
