Linda Maxine Godwin(born July 2, 1952) is an Americanscientistand retiredNASAastronaut.[2]Godwin joined NASA in 1980 and became an astronaut in July 1986. She retired in 2010.  During her career, Godwin completed four space flights and logged over 38 days in space. Godwin also served as the assistant to the director for exploration, Flight Crew Operations Directorate at theJohnson Space Center. Since retiring from NASA, she accepted the position of professor in the Department of Physics and Astronomy at the University of Missouri.[3]

Early life
Godwin was born July 2, 1952, inCape Girardeau, Missouri, but her hometown isJackson, Missouri.  She graduated fromJackson High Schoolin Jackson, Missouri, in 1970, then received a Bachelor of Science degree inmathematicsandphysicsfromSoutheast Missouri State Universityin 1974, and a Master of Science degree and a Doctorate inphysicsfrom theUniversity of Missouriin 1976 and 1980.

Personal life
Godwin is a member of theAmerican Physical Society, theNinety-Nines, Inc.,Association of Space Explorers,Aircraft Owners and Pilots Association.

Academic experience
After completing undergraduate studies in physics and mathematics at Southeast Missouri State University, Godwin attended graduate school at theUniversity of MissouriinColumbia, Missouri. During that time she taught undergraduate physicslabsand was the recipient of severalresearch assistantships. She conducted research in low temperaturesolid state physics, including studies inelectron tunnelingand vibrational modes of absorbedmolecularspecies onmetallicsubstrates(surfaces) atliquidheliumtemperatures. Results of her research have been published in several journals.[5]
Godwin is aninstrument ratedprivatepilot.[5]

NASA career
Godwin joined NASA in 1980, in the Payload Operations Division, Mission Operations Directorate, where she worked in payload integration (attached payloads and Spacelabs), and as a flight controller and payloads officer on severalSpace Shuttlemissions.
Selected by NASA as an astronaut candidate in June 1985,[6]Godwin became an astronaut in July 1986.[2]Her technical assignments have included working with flightsoftwareverification in theShuttle Avionics Integration Laboratory(SAIL), and coordinating mission development activities for theInertialUpper Stage (IUS), deployable payloads, and Spacelab missions. She also has served as chief of astronaut appearances, chief of the Mission Development Branch of the Astronaut Office and as the astronaut liaison to its Educational Working Group, deputy chief of the Astronaut Office, and deputy director, Flight Crew Operations Directorate. Godwin is currently the assistant to the director for exploration, Flight Crew Operations Directorate at theJohnson Space Center.[2]
A veteran of four space flights, Godwin has logged over 38 days in space, including over tenEVAhours in twospacewalks. In 1991 she served as a mission specialist onSTS-37, was the payload commander onSTS-59in 1994, flew onSTS-76in 1996, aMirdocking mission, and served onSTS-108/International Space StationFlight UF-1 in 2001.[7]

Spaceflight experience

STS-37
Godwin served as mission specialist 1 on the crew ofSTS-37.[8]: 63–64Atlantiswas launched fromKennedy Space Center Launch Complex 39BApril 5, 1991, 14:22:45 UTC and returned to land atEdwards Air Force Base,California, April 11, 1991, 13:55:29 UTC. During the 93 orbits of the mission, the crew deployed theCompton Gamma Ray Observatory(GRO) to study gamma ray sources in theuniverse.[9]GRO, at about 35,000 pounds (16,000 kg), was the heaviest payload deployed to date by the Shuttle Remote Manipulator System (RMS).[10]The crew also conducted an unscheduled spacewalk to free the GRO highgainantenna, and conducted the first scheduled extravehicular activity in5+1⁄2years to test concepts for moving about large space structures. Several middeck experiments and activities were conducted including test of elements of a heat pipe to study fluid transfer processed inmicrogravityenvironments(SHARE), a chemical processing apparatus to characterize the structure ofbiologicalmaterials (BIMDA), and an experiment to grow larger and more perfectproteincrystalsthan can be grown on the ground (PCG II). Atlantis carriedamateur radioequipment for voice contact, fast scan and slow scanTV, andpacket radio. Several hundred contacts were made with amateur radio operators around the world. Mission duration was 143 hours, 32 minutes, 44 seconds.[11][12]

STS-59
Godwin served as payload commander on the crew ofSTS-59.[8]: 92Endeavourlaunched fromKennedy Space Center Launch Complex 39AApril 9, 1994, 11:05 UTC. STS-59 was the SpaceRadarLaboratory (SRL) mission. SRL consisted of three large radars, SIR-C/X-SAR (Shuttle Imaging Radar C/X-Band Synthetic Aperture Radar), and acarbon monoxidesensor that were used to enhance studies of theEarth's surface andatmosphere. The imaging radars operated in threefrequenciesand fourpolarizations. This multispectral capability of the radars provided information about the Earth's surface over a wide range of scales not discernible with previous single-frequency experiments.[13]The carbon monoxide sensor MAPS (Measurement ofAir PollutionbySatellite) usedgasfilterradiometryto measure the global distribution of CO in thetroposphere. Real-time crew observations of surface phenomena andclimaticconditions augmented with over 14,000 photographs aided investigators in interpretation and calibration of the data. The mission concluded with a landing at Edwards Air Force Base, California, April 20, 1994, 16:55 UTC after orbiting the Earth 183 times in 269 hours, 29 minutes.[14][15]

STS-76
Godwin served as mission specialist 3 on the crew ofSTS-76.[8]: 109–110Atlantislaunched from Kennedy Space Center Launch Complex 39B from March 22, 1996, 08:13:04 UTC. STS-76 was the third docking mission to the Russian space stationMir. Following rendezvous and docking withMir, transfer of a NASA astronaut toMirfor a 5-month stay was accomplished to begin a continuous presence of United States astronauts aboardMirfor the next two-year period. The crew also transferred 4,800 pounds (2,200 kg) of science and mission hardware, food, water and air toMirand returned over 1,100 pounds (500 kg) of U.S. andESAscience and Russian hardware. Godwin performed a six-hour spacewalk, the first while docked to an orbiting space station, to mount experiment packages on theMirdocking module to detect and assess debris and contamination in a space station environment. The packages will be retrieved by a future shuttle mission. The Spacehab module carried in the Shuttle payload bay was utilized extensively for transfer and return stowage oflogisticsand science and also carried Biorack, a small multipurpose laboratory used during this mission for research of plant and animalcellularfunction.[16]This mission was also the first flight ofKidsat, anelectronic cameracontrolled by classroom students via a Ku-band link between JSC Mission Control and the Shuttle, which usesdigital photographyfrom the Shuttle for science and education. The STS-76 mission concluded with a successful landing at Edwards Air Force Base, California, March 31, 1996, 13:28:57 UTC after 145 orbits of the Earth, traveling 3,800,000 miles (6,100,000 km) in 221 hours and 15 minutes.[17][18]

STS-108
Godwin served as mission specialist 1 on the crew ofSTS-108.[8]: 160–161Endeavourlaunched from Kennedy Space Center Launch Complex 39B 5 December 2001 22:19:28 UTC. STS-108 was the 12th shuttle flight to visit the International Space Station.Endeavour's crew delivered the Expedition-4 crew and returned the Expedition-3 crew. The crew unloaded over 4,600 pounds (2,100 kg)[19]of supplies, logistics and science experiments from the Raffaello Multi-Purpose Logistics Module and repacked over 3,000 pounds (1,400 kg) of items no longer needed on the station for return to Earth. Godwin used the Shuttle'sroboticarm to install the MPLM onto the Station Node, and participated in a spacewalk to wrapthermal blanketsaround ISSSolarArray BetaGimbalAssemblies. STS-108 concluded with a successful landing at theShuttle Landing Facility17 December 2001 17:56:13 UTC after 185 Earth orbits, traveling 4,800,000 miles (7,700,000 km) in 283 hours and 36 minutes.[8]: 160–161[20]
