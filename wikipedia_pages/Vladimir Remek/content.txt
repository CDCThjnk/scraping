He flew aboardSoyuz 28from 2 to 10 March 1978, becoming the first and onlyCzechoslovakin space. As the first cosmonaut from a country other than theSoviet Unionor theUnited States, and with the entry of theCzech RepublicandSlovakiainto theEuropean Union, Remek is considered to be the first astronaut from the European Union. Remek was a member of theEuropean Parliamentbetween 2004 and 2013 for theCommunist Party of Bohemia and Moravia. From 2014 to 2018, he was theCzech Ambassador to Russia.

Early life and military career
Remek was born on 26 September 1948 inČeské Budějovice(now in theCzech Republic).[8]He spent two years studying at theobservatoryin Kraví hora,Brnobetween 1962 and 1964.[9]Remek was influenced by his father, Jozef Remek, himself a military pilot.[10]Remek was an active member both in thePioneersand theCzechoslovak Union of Youth. He studied mathematics and physics at middle school inČáslavwhere he earned awards intrack runningthe400-meter,800-meter, and1,500-meterevents. Remek graduated in 1966 and proceeded toVyšší Letecké Učiliště, an aviation school inKošice, where he trained in anAero L-29 Delfín.[11]Remek graduated in 1970, and was commissioned as a lieutenant in theCzechoslovak Air Force.[8][12]Remek served as a fighter pilot, flyingMiG-21sin the 1st Fighter Air Regiment.[13]In the 1970s Remek married his first wife, Czech actress Hana Davidová, the daughter of politicianVáclav David. They had a daughter together, Anna, in 1980.[2]He had a second daughter, Jana, three years after the first,[14]with his second wife, also called Jana.[3][15]
From 1972 to 1976, Remek studied at theGagarin Air Force Academy. Upon his return toCzechoslovakiain 1976, he was promoted to captain and appointed deputy commander of his fighter regiment, after which Remek went back to Russia to train for the Soviet-led space program. Following his return from space in March 1978, Remek spent time in theCzechoslovak People's Army(ČSLA) staff as the deputy director of the Flight Research Institute in Prague.[16]In 1986, Remek became the deputy commander of a flight division based in Čáslav. In 1988, he graduated fromVoroshilov-Staff Academy of Soviet Air Forceand was appointed to his highest command, as deputy of the 2nd Air Defense Division stationed inMoravia.[6][11]Following theVelvet Revolutionin 1989, Remek was relegated to a role as Director of theMuseum for Aviation and Astronautics in Prague.[6]Following his retirement from theCzech Air Forcein 1995, Remek represented Czech firm CZ Strakonice and joint venture CZ–Turbo-GAZ in Moscow.[3][6][17]

Interkosmos program
Remek (then a Captain) joined theInterkosmosprogram in 1976; his backup wasOldřich Pelčák, the other Czechoslovak cosmonaut selected to participate with the program. During the flight, Remek experimented with theKristallfurnace on board the capsule.[18]The mission, coinciding with the 30th anniversary of the Soviet-backed1948 Czechoslovak coup d'état, and including Remek, the son of a Czech mother and Slovak father, had propaganda value in stressing Czechoslovak-Soviet cooperation.[19]Remek himself has not denied this although he retains pride in his voyage regardless of the circumstances. On theSoyuz 28mission that launched 2 March 1978, he became the first cosmonaut from a country other than theSoviet Unionor theUnited States, and with the entry of theCzech Republicinto theEuropean Union, Remek is considered to be the first astronaut from the European Union.[20][21]After Remek's flight, he was celebrated in his home country with a series of receptions at factories and other civil workplaces. He was also recognized at a ceremony atPrague Castleas a guest ofGustáv Husák, then theGeneral Secretary of the Communist Party of Czechoslovakia.[22]On 16 March, Remek andAleksei Gubarev, the other member of the crew, were awarded the medalHero of the Soviet Union.[23]Czechoslovak reaction to Remek's flight included comments about the media's inundation focused on Remek and the fact that he was only able to journey with a Soviet cosmonaut as if Remek needed aminder. One joke went: "Why didn't the Soviets send up two Czechoslovak cosmonauts? Because they would've landed in West Germany." Remek himself joked that his Soviet counterpart would slap Remek's hands off of controls if he touched anything without permission.[24]French astronautJean-Loup Chrétienexperienced this same behavior onboardSoyuz TM-7in 1988.[25][26]

Political career
Due in part to his previous business contacts in Russia, Remek was appointed to theCzech Embassy in Moscowas a Trade and Economic Counselor.[3][17]During the2004 European Parliament election, Remek was a candidate for theCommunist Party of Bohemia and Moraviaand, being second on the list behindMiloslav Ransdorf, was elected into the European Parliament.[27]During his first term (20 July 2004 to 13 July 2009), Remek was a member of the Confederal Group of theEuropean United Left–Nordic Green Leftin the European Parliament.[28]He was a vocal proponent of the EU'sGalileo satellite constellation, warning that bureaucratic delay could cede opportunity to theBeiDou, a Chinese competitor.[29]He was reelected in2009. WhenPetr Kolářresigned as theCzech Ambassador to Russiain December 2012, the ambassadorship sat empty for a year until thePresident of the Czech Republic,Miloš Zeman, appointed Remek in January 2014.[30]The appointment met with controversy as it was against the wishes of Zeman's Foreign Minister,Karel Schwarzenberg.[31]Observers have noted Remek has a friendly history with the Russians and although his communist affiliations are a minority in Russia, his appointment represents Zeman's pragmatic and pro-Russia stance.[32][33]
