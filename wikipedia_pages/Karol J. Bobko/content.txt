He attended theAerospace Research Pilot SchoolatEdwards Air Force Base,California, and was assigned as an astronaut to the USAFManned Orbiting Laboratory(MOL) program in 1966.[6][7]
Bobko logged over 6,600 hours flight time in the F-100,F-104, F-105,T-33,T-38, and other aircraft.[2]

NASA career
Bobko became part ofNASA Astronaut Group 7in September 1969 after the cancellation of theManned Orbiting Laboratory(MOL) program. He was a crewmember on the highly successfulSkylab Medical Experiment Altitude Test(SMEAT) – a 56-day ground simulation of theSkylabmission, enabling crewmen to collect medical experiments baseline data and evaluate equipment, operations and procedures.[6]
Bobko was a member of the astronaut support crew for theApollo–Soyuz Test Project(ASTP). This historic first internationalcrewed space flightwas completed in July 1975. Subsequently, he was a member of the support crew for theSpace ShuttleApproach and Landing Testsconducted at Edwards Air Force Base. He served alternately asCAPCOMand primechase pilotduring these Approach and Landing Test (ALT) flights.[2]
In preparation for the first flight ofColumbia(STS-1) Bobko served as the lead astronaut in the test and checkout group atKennedy Space Center.[2]
A veteran of three space flights, Bobko logged a total of 386 hours inspace. He was the first graduate of theUS Air Force Academyto travel in space and the first astronaut to fly on three different shuttle missions.[8]He was the pilot onSTS-6(April 4–9, 1983); and was the mission commander onSTS-51-D(April 12–19, 1985) andSTS-51-J(October 3–7, 1985).[2]

Spaceflight experience
Bobko was pilot for STS-6, which launched from Kennedy Space Center in Florida, on April 4, 1983. During the maiden voyage ofChallenger, the crew deployed a largecommunicationssatellite(TDRS-1) and therocketstage (Inertial Upper Stage) required to boost it togeosynchronous orbit.[6]The STS-6 crew also conducted the first Shuttlespacewalk(EVA) and additionally conducted numerous other experiments in materials processing and the recording oflightningactivities from space.[6]There were also threeGetaway Specialsactivated on the flight. After 120 hours of orbital operations,Challengerlanded on theconcreterunwayat Edwards Air Force Base in California, on April 9, 1983.[9]
On his second mission, Bobko was the commander ofSTS-51-Dwhich launched from Kennedy Space Center on April 12, 1985.[6]The mission was to deploy two communications satellites, performelectrophoresisandechocardiographoperations in space, in addition to accomplishing other experiments. When one of the communications satellites malfunctioned, the first unscheduled spacewalk was made to activate the satellite which requiredrendezvousand operations with the remote manipulator arm.[6]After 168 hours of orbital operations,Discoverylanded on Runway 33 at Kennedy Space Center on April 19, 1985.[10]
Bobko's final flight was as commander ofSTS-51-J, the second Space ShuttleDepartment of Defensemission, which launched from Kennedy Space Center on October 3, 1985.[6]This mission carried classified payloads for the Department of Defense and was the second time that a Shuttle mission was used solely for Department of Defense activities.[6]This was the maiden voyage ofAtlantis. After 98 hours of orbital operations,Atlantislanded on Edwards Air Force Base Lakebed Runway 23 on October 7, 1985. Bobko became the first person to fly on three different Space Shuttles.[11]He was the only astronaut to have flown on the maiden flights of two Space Shuttles.[12]

In 1988, Bobko retired from NASA and the Air Force to join the firm ofBooz Allen Hamilton, inHouston, Texas.[6]At Booz Allen he was a principal and managed efforts dealing with human space flight. His areas of emphasis were: high performance training simulation, hardware and softwaresystems engineering, spacecraft checkout and testing,space stationdevelopment and program integration.[2]
In 2000, Bobko joinedSPACEHAB, Inc. in Houston, Texas, where he was Vice President for Strategic Programs.[6]He led an organization that develops concepts, processes and hardware for future spaceflight applications.[2]In 2005, Bobko joinedScience Applications International Corporation(SAIC) as Program Manager for the NASAAmes Research CenterSimulation Laboratories (SimLabs) contract.[6]
