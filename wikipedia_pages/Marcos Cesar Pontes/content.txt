Marcos Cesar Pontes(born 11 March 1963) is a Brazilian Air Force pilot,engineer,AEBastronaut, politician and author. He became the first South American and the firstLusophoneto go into space when he docked onto the International Space Station aboardSoyuz TMA-8on 30 March 2006.  He is the only Brazilian to have completed theNASAastronaut training program, although he switched to training in Russia after NASA'sSpace Shuttleprogram encountered problems. AfterJair Bolsonaro's election asPresident of Brazilin2018, Pontes was officially nominated to be Minister of Science, Technology and Innovation, a post which he accepted days later and assumed when Bolsonaro's government began.[2][3]He left the post on 31 March 2022 and in the same year waselectedfederal senator for his state, São Paulo.

Early life
Pontes was born in the town ofBauru, in the southeastern state ofSão Paulo. His father Vergílio was a civil servant of the Instituto Brasileiro do Café and his mother Zuleika was clerk of the Rede Ferroviária Federal (RFFSA).[4]

Air Force and Space career
Pontes is one of the most experienced jet pilots in theBrazilian Air Force(FAB), where he holds the rank ofLieutenant-Coloneland has flown more than 2000 hours in 25 different aircraft[clarification needed]. 
In June 1998, he was selected by theBrazilian Space Agencyto train in the NASA space program after he acquired a space-related background in the Aeronautical Engineering division of the Instituto Tecnológico de Aeronáutica (theAeronautics Institute of Technology, or "ITA"). He began NASA training in August 1998 and qualified as Space ShuttleMission Specialistin December 2000. He attended theNaval Postgraduate Schoolof theUS Navyin 1998.
Initially, Pontes' maiden space flight was scheduled to be on a Space Shuttle, where he was to help transport the ExPRESS Pallet, which would have been theInternational Space Station's first Brazilian-made component, into orbit. Negotiations between NASA and AEB (the Brazilian Space Agency) fell through due to budgetary concerns. During the delay, Pontes ran a campaign to pressure the Brazilian government to complete the Express Pallet, and he worked on technical assignments in the Astronaut Office Space Station Operations Branch at NASA. His flight was postponed indefinitely when AEB confirmed that it could not produce the Express Pallet and its components for NASA.[5][6]
On 2 September 2005, an agreement between the governments of Brazil and Russia was reached which provided for Pontes to train atStar City, nearMoscow, to learn about the Soyuz's operational and life-support systems, and to fly to the International Space Station in March 2006.  The agreement, which cost about US$20 million[clarification needed]was signed by the presidents of theBrazilianandRussianspace agencies,Sérgio GaudenziandAnatoli Perminov, respectively.
Pontes' flight coincided with celebrations of the 100th anniversary of Brazilian aviation pioneerAlberto Santos-Dumont's successful flight of afixed-wing airplanein Paris in October 1906.
On 30 March 2006, Pontes became the first Brazilian and the first native Portuguese-speaking person to go into space, where he stayed on the International Space Station for a week. During his trip, Pontes carried out eight experiments selected by the Brazilian Space Agency. He landed in Kazakhstan on April 8, 2006, with the crew ofExpedition 12.[7]
Following the Soyuz mission, Pontes returned to his technical duties for the International Space Station Program at theJohnson Space Center, working with FIESP/SENAI-SP on the development and fabrication of the Brazilian parts for the ISS.[citation needed]
Pontes entered the reserve of the Brazilian Air Force and awaits a new space mission. He is also an Invited Researcher at the Institute for Advanced Studies of theUniversity of São Pauloat São Carlos. He is an ambassador ofUNIDOandWorldSkills. Pontes opened an educational foundation and a tourism agency together with the future Brazilian space tourist Marcos Palhares, who will be traveling to space through theVirgin Galactic.[8][9][10][11]
Pontes announced his intention to visit space a second time back in 2009.[12][8]

Political career
In his 2011 bookMissão Cumprida, he also declared that he is interested in a possible candidacy for an unspecified political post in Brazil and he tried to be elected as "Deputado Federal" during the2014 São Paulo gubernatorial election.[13]In the2018 São Paulo gubernatorial electionhe was elected side withMajor Olímpioas second alternate in the Senate.[14]
On 31 October,Jair Bolsonaroannounced that he would be the nextMinister of Science and Technology.[15]This choice left the scientific community with polarized opinions, ranging from how the public sees the profession of astronaut in connection with science and the fact that the minister is not an active scientist and researcher, in addition to concern about his lack of political articulation.[16]

Minister of Science
After the disclosure of data on deforestation in theAmazonbyINPE, discredited by Bolsonaro,[17]Marcos Pontes called the then President of InpeRicardo Galvãoto address the way he has been acting in the media and also declared to share "...the strangeness expressed by our President Bolsonaro...".[18]no matter how much he doesn't believe the data to be false.[19]
On 7 August 2019 the resignation of Ricardo Galvão was published[20]after his resignation on 2 August.[21]He was exonerated at the request of Bolsonaro.[17]Directors of research centres linked to the Ministry asked Pontes to intercede on behalf of Galvão, something that did not happen.[22]
Military Darcton Policarpo Damião was chosen to take over Inpe on an interim basis.[21]
In July 2020, he tested positive forCOVID-19.[23]
In a survey published byVejamagazine in October 2021, it was revealed that the minister had made 107 international trips, had stayed 1 in 3 days away for travel among his nearly 1000 days in office, had spent more than R$500,000 (US$ 100,000), and was the minister in the Bolsonaro government who traveled abroad the most.[24]This travel expense becomes relevant after he criticized the government for cutting R$600 million (US$ 200,000,000) from the Science and Technology Ministry.[25]

Works
Besides his work as an astronaut and Air Force commander, Marcos also authored four books:[26]

He also writes articles on his website. The main themes are motivation and space travel.

Controversies

Critics from National Congress
In 2006, Marcos Pontes returned to Brazil after theMissão Centenário, deciding to enter theAeronauticsreserve. In this sense, the repercussion around the situation became very wide, due to the indignation that was demonstrated by theNational Congress. At first, thePalácio do Planalto, AEB (Brazilian Space Agency) and Aeronautics expected that Pontes could offer a stimulus factor to the space program and to new adhesions to the Armed Forces, as well as mentoring and training to new astronauts, justifying an investment of 10 million dollars from the Federal Government,[27][28]strongly defended by the Lula Government, who even talked to the astronaut in videoconference on the International Space Station: "In few moments in the history of Brazil, we were proud of a Brazilian like we are of you. You, when you departed, reminded me ofAyrton Sennawith the national flag," Lula said.[29]After the decision for the inactivity of Marcos Pontes' functions, President Lula did not comment on the choice, which had several frustration pronouncements from other congressmen, such asWalter Pinheiro(PT), at the time member of the House Science and Technology Commission;Alberto Goldman(PSDB), congressman forSão Pauloin 2006;Orlando Fantazzini(PSOL) andSérgio Gaudenzi. In the view of politicians, who expected the return of astronaut learning to the Brazilian Space Program, the entity should create protection mechanisms for possible future investments in other astronauts, taking into account that the services funded by the government are not lost in the private sphere.[30][27][28]

Investigation by the Military Prosecutor
In 2006, Pontes was investigated by theMilitary Prosecutorto determine whether he had violated Article 204 of theMilitary Penal Code, which prohibits active military involvement in any commercial activity.[31]In the investigation, the MPM inquired about the website Conexão Espacial, owned by the astronaut's press officer, Christiane Gonçalves Corrêa, then owner of the company Portally Eventos e Produções, about the sale of T-shirts and caps with the image of Marcos from 2002 until the date of his departure. In September 2017, documents were released byThe Interceptnewspaper, which showed Marcos' supposed status as a partner in the company, but which had always been denied by him. After the extinctive prescription of the investigation, Pontes became a majority partner of the company, with 80% of participation, while Christiane Corrêa kept 20% of participation. The mother of the advisor, who owned about 45% of the shares, left the firm after Pontes joined.[32]In August 2018, after the investigation had already prescribed, the appeal against Pontes was tabled and filed away by Supreme Court MinisterRosa Weber.[31]
