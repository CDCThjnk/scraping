Biography

Early years and education
England was born May 15, 1942, inIndianapolis, Indiana, but his hometown isWest Fargo, North Dakota. He attended primary school in Indianapolis, Indiana, and graduated from high school in North Dakota. At theMassachusetts Institute of Technology(MIT) he received hisBachelor of ScienceandMaster of Sciencedegrees inEarthandplanetary sciences(course 12A) in 1965, and aDoctor of Philosophydegree in Earth and planetary sciences in 1970.[2]England was a graduate fellow at MIT for the three years immediately preceding his first assignment to NASA.[3]

Career
England was selected as a scientist-astronaut by NASA in August 1967, as part of the 6th astronaut selection.[4]At 25 years 81 days old, he was the youngest candidate to be selected up to that time.[5][6]He subsequently completed the initial academic training and a 53-week course in flight training atLaughlin Air Force Base,Texas.  He received his wings with distinguished honors in April 1969.[7]England served as a support crewman for theApollo 13and16flights. He was also an EVA CapCom during the Apollo 16 mission, talking to the astronauts while they explored the surface of the Moon.[8]Notably, he developed and communicated instructions for construction of thelithium hydroxidecanisters on Apollo 13.[9]
England andPhilip Chapmanresigned from NASA in 1972, citing the era's decline in crewed missions and severe dearth of flight opportunities. Neither had flown in space at that point. England remained with the federal government at theUnited States Geological Survey, where he served as deputy chief of the Office of Geochemistry and Geophysics.[10]He also served as associate editor for theJournal of Geophysical Research. He served on theNational Academy's Space Studies Board, and on several federal committees concerned with Antarctic policy,nuclear wastecontainment, and federal science and technology.[3]
England returned to theJohnson Space Centerin 1979 as a senior scientist-astronaut (mission specialist), was assigned to the operation mission development group of the Astronaut Office, and eventually managed that group.[3]
STS-51-F, carrying a seven-man crew andSpacelab-2, was launched fromKennedy Space Center,Floridaon July 29, 1985. This mission was the first pallet-onlySpacelabmission and the first mission to operate the Spacelab Instrument Pointing System (IPS). It carried 13 major experiments of which seven were in the field of astronomy andsolar physics, three were for studies of the Earth's ionosphere, two were life science experiments, and 1 studied the properties ofsuperfluidhelium. England was responsible for activating and operating the Spacelab systems, operating the IPS and the Remote Manipulator System, assisting with experiment operations, and performing a contingency EVA had one been necessary. After 126 orbits of the Earth, STS 51-FChallengerlanded atEdwards Air Force Base,California, on August 6, 1985.[3]
From May 1986 to May 1987, England served as a program scientist forSpace Station Freedom(which later evolved into theInternational Space Station). From June 1987 to December 1987, he taughtRemote SensingGeophysicsatRice University. England retired from NASA in 1988.[3]

Post-NASA career
England was the dean of the College of Engineering and Computer Science and professor ofelectrical engineeringandcomputer scienceat theUniversity of Michigan–Dearborn.[1]He is also a professor of electrical engineering and computer science and atmospheric, oceanic, and of space sciences in the College of Engineering at theUniversity of Michigan, Ann Arbor.[11]England also served as a member of the Michigan Pipeline Safety Advisory Board[12]and the Mackinac Straits Corridor Authority.[13]

Personal
England was married for 51 years to his childhood sweetheart, Kathi (Kreutz) until her death in 2013 and has two daughters: Heidi and Heather. He has five grandchildren: Brandi, Spenser, Charlene, Brock, Sage..[14]His recreational interests includesailingandamateur radio.[3]
