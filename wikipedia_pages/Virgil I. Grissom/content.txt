Virgil Ivan"Gus"Grissom(April 3, 1926 – January 27, 1967) was an American engineer and pilot in theUnited States Air Force, as well as one of the originalMercury Sevenselected by theNational Aeronautics and Space AdministrationforProject Mercury, a program  to train and launch astronauts intoouter space. Grissom went on to be aProject GeminiandApollo programastronaut for NASA. As a member of theNASA Astronaut Corps, Grissom was the second American to fly in space in 1961. He was also the second American to fly in space twice, preceded only byJoe Walkerwith his sub-orbitalX-15flights.
Grissom was aWorld War IIandKorean Warveteran, mechanical engineer, andUSAFtest pilot. He was a recipient of theDistinguished Flying Cross, theAir Medalwith anoak leaf cluster, twoNASA Distinguished Service Medals, and, posthumously, theCongressional Space Medal of Honor.
As commander ofAS-204(Apollo 1), Grissom died with astronautsEd WhiteandRoger B. Chaffeeon January 27, 1967, during a pre-launch test for the Apollo 1 mission atCape Kennedy, Florida.

Early life
Virgil Ivan Grissom was born in the small town ofMitchell, Indiana, on April 3, 1926,[1]to Dennis David Grissom, a signalman for theBaltimore and Ohio Railroad, and Cecile King Grissom, a homemaker. Virgil was the family's second child; his older sister, Lena, died a year prior to Gus' birth. He was followed by three younger siblings: a sister, Wilma, and two brothers, Norman and Lowell.[2]Grissom started school at Riley grade school. His interest in flying began during that time, building model airplanes.[1]He received his nickname when his friend was reading his name on a scorecard upside down and misread "Griss" as "Gus".[1]
As a youth, Grissom attended the localChurch of Christ, where he remained a lifelong member. He joined the localBoy ScoutTroop and earned the rank ofStar Scout.[3]Grissom credited the Scouts for his love of hunting and fishing. He was the leader of the honor guard in his troop.[4]His first jobs were delivering newspapers forThe Indianapolis Starin the morning and theBedford Timesin the evening.[1]In the summer he picked fruit in area orchards and worked at a dry-goods store.[4]He also worked at a local meat market, a service station, and a clothing store in Mitchell.
Grissom started attendingMitchell High Schoolin 1940.[4]He wanted to play varsity basketball but he was too short. His father encouraged him to find sports he was more suited for, and he joined the swimming team.[4]Although he excelled at mathematics, Grissom was an average high school student in other subjects.[5]He graduated from high school in 1944.
In addition, Grissom occasionally spent time at a local airport inBedford, Indiana, where he first became interested in aviation. A local attorney who owned a small plane would take him on flights and taught him the basics of flying.[6]
Grissom was aFreemason.[7][8]

World War II
World War IIbegan while Grissom was still in high school, but he was eager to join the armed services upon graduation. Grissom enlisted as anaviation cadetin theU.S. Army Air Forcesduring his senior year in high school, and completed an entrance exam in November 1943. Grissom was inducted into the U.S. Army Air Forces on August 8, 1944, atFort Benjamin Harrison, Indiana. He was sent toSheppard FieldinWichita Falls, Texas, for five weeks of basic flight training, and was later stationed atBrooks FieldinSan Antonio, Texas. In January 1945 Grissom was assigned toBoca Raton Army Airfieldin Florida. Although he was interested in becoming a pilot, most of Grissom's time before his discharge in 1945 was spent as aclerk.[9]

Post-war employment
Grissom was discharged from military service in November 1945, after the war had ended, and returned to Mitchell, where he took a job at Carpenter Body Works, a local bus manufacturing business. Grissom was determined to make his career in aviation and attend college. Using theG.I. Billfor partial payment of his school tuition, Grissom enrolled atPurdue Universityin September 1946.[10]
Due to a shortage of campus housing during her husband's first semester in college inWest Lafayette, Indiana, Grissom's wife, Betty, stayed in Mitchell living with her parents, while Grissom lived in a rented apartment with another male student. Betty Grissom joined her husband on campus during his second semester, and the couple settled into a small, one-bedroom apartment. Grissom continued his studies at Purdue, worked part-time as a cook at a local restaurant, and took summer classes to finish college early, while his wife worked the night shift as a long-distance operator for the Indiana Bell Telephone Company to help pay for his schooling and their living expenses. Grissom graduated from Purdue with aBachelor of Sciencedegree inmechanical engineeringin February 1950.[11]

Korean War
After he graduated from Purdue, Grissom re-enlisted in the newly formedU.S. Air Force. He was accepted into theAir Cadet Basic Training ProgramatRandolph Air Force BaseinUniversal City, Texas. Upon completion of the program, he was assigned toWilliams Air Force BaseinMesa, Arizona, where his wife, Betty, and infant son, Scott, joined him, but the family remained there only briefly. In March 1951, Grissom received hispilot wingsand a commission as asecond lieutenant. Nine months later, in December 1951, Grissom and his family moved into new living quarters inPresque Isle, Maine, where he was assigned toPresque Isle Air Force Baseand became a member of the75th Fighter-Interceptor Squadron.[12]
With the ongoingKorean War, Grissom's squadron was dispatched to the war zone in February 1952. There he flew as anF-86 Sabrereplacement pilot and was reassigned to the334th Fighter Squadronof the4th Fighter Interceptor Wingstationed atKimpo Air Base.[13]He flew one hundredcombat missionsduring approximately six months of service in Korea, including multiple occasions when he broke up air raids from North KoreanMiGs. On March 11, 1952, Grissom was promoted tofirst lieutenantand was cited for his "superlative airmanship" for his actions on March 23, 1952, when he flew cover for a photo reconnaissance mission.[14]Grissom was also awarded theDistinguished Flying Crossand theAir Medalwith anoak leaf clusterfor his military service in Korea.[15]
After flying his quota of one hundred missions, Grissom asked to remain in Korea to fly another twenty-five flights, but his request was denied. Grissom returned to the United States to serve as aflight instructoratBryan AFBinBryan, Texas, where he was joined by his wife, Betty, and son, Scott. The Grissoms' second child, Mark, was born there in 1953. Grissom soon learned that flight instructors faced their own set of on-the-job risks. During a training exercise with a cadet, the trainee pilot caused a flap to break off from their two-seat trainer, sending it into a roll. Grissom quickly climbed from the rear seat of the small aircraft to take over the controls and safely land it.[16]
In August 1955, Grissom was reassigned to the U.S.Air Force Institute of Technology(AFIT) atWright-Patterson Air Force BasenearDayton, OhioofAir University. After completing the year-long course he earned abachelor's degreeinaeromechanicsin 1956.[17]In October 1956, he entered theU.S. Air Force Test Pilot SchoolatEdwards Air Force Basein California, and returned to Wright-Patterson AFB inOhioin May 1957, after attaining the rank ofcaptain. Grissom served as atest pilotassigned to the fighter branch.[18][19][20]

NASA career
In 1959, Grissom received an officialteletypemessage instructing him to report to an address in Washington, D.C., wearing civilian clothes. The message was classified"Top Secret"and Grissom was ordered not to discuss its contents with anyone. Of the 508 military candidates who were considered, he was one of 110 test pilots whose credentials had earned them an invitation to learn more about the U.S. space program in general and itsProject Mercury. Grissom was intrigued by the program, but knew that competition for the final spots would be fierce.[21][22]
Grissom passed the initial screening in Washington, D.C., and was among the thirty-nine candidates sent to theLovelace ClinicinAlbuquerque, New Mexico, and the Aeromedical Laboratory of the Wright Air Development Center in Dayton, Ohio, to undergo extensive physical and psychological testing. He was nearly disqualified when doctors discovered that he suffered fromhay fever, but was permitted to continue after he argued that his allergies would not be a problem due to the absence of ragweed pollen in space.[23]
On April 13, 1959, Grissom received official notification that he had been selected as one of the seven Project Mercury astronauts. Grissom and the six other men, after taking a leave of absence from their respective branches of the military service, reported to the Space Task Group atLangley Air Force BaseinVirginiaon April 27, 1959, to begin their astronaut training.[24][25][26]

Project Mercury
On July 21, 1961, Grissom was pilot of the second Project Mercury flight,Mercury-Redstone 4. Grissom named his spacecraftLiberty Bell 7after theLiberty Bell, and drew a crack on it as a nod to the bell.Liberty Bell 7was launched fromCape Canaveral, Florida, asub-orbital flightthat lasted 15 minutes and 37 seconds.[19][22]Aftersplashdownin the Atlantic Ocean, theLiberty Bell 7's emergency explosive bolts unexpectedly fired, blowing off the hatch and causing water to flood into the spacecraft. Grissom quickly exited through the open hatch and into the ocean. While waiting for recovery helicopters fromUSSRandolphto pick him up, Grissom struggled to keep from drowning after hisspacesuitbegan losing buoyancy due to an open air inlet. Grissom managed to stay afloat until he was pulled from the water by a helicopter and taken to theU.S. Navyship. In the meantime another recovery helicopter tried to lift and retrieve theLiberty Bell 7, but the flooding spacecraft became too heavy, forcing the recovery crew to cut it loose, and it ultimately sank.[22]
When reporters at a news conference surrounded Grissom after his space flight to ask how he felt, Grissom replied, "Well, I was scared a good portion of the time; I guess that's a pretty good indication."[27]Grissom stated he had done nothing to cause the hatch to blow, and no definitive explanation for the incident was found.[22][28]Robert F. Thompson, director of Mercury operations, was dispatched toUSSRandolphbySpace Task GroupDirector Robert Gilruth and spoke with Grissom upon his arrival on the aircraft carrier. Grissom explained that he had gotten ahead in the mission timeline and had removed the detonator cap, and also pulled the safety pin. Once the pin was removed, the trigger was no longer held in place and could have inadvertently fired as a result of ocean wave action, bobbing as a result of helicopter rotor wash, or other activity. NASA officials concluded Grissom had not necessarily initiated the firing of the explosive hatch, which would have required pressing a plunger that required five pounds of force to depress.[29]Hitting this metal trigger with the hand typically left a large bruise,[30]but Grissom was found not to have any of the telltale hand bruising.[22]
While the debate continued about the premature detonation ofLiberty Bell 7's hatch bolts, precautions were initiated for subsequent flights. Fellow Mercury astronautWally Schirra, at the end of hisOctober 3, 1962, flight, remained inside his spacecraft until it was safely aboard the recovery ship, and made a point of deliberately blowing the hatch to get out of the spacecraft, bruising his hand.[22][31]
Grissom's spacecraft wasrecovered in 1999, but no evidence was found that could conclusively explain how the explosive hatch release had occurred. Later,Guenter Wendt, pad leader for the early American crewed space launches, wrote that he believed a small cover over the external release actuator was accidentally lost sometime during the flight or splashdown. Another possible explanation was that the hatch's T-handle may have been tugged by a stray parachute suspension line, or was perhaps damaged by the heat of re-entry, and after cooling upon splashdown it contracted and caught fire.[25][32]It has also been suggested that a static electricity discharge during initial contact between the spacecraft and the rescue helicopter may have caused the hatch's explosive bolts to blow. The co-pilot of the helicopter, U.S. Marine Corps Lieutenant John Reinhard, had the job of using a cutting pole to snip off an antenna before the helicopter could latch onto the capsule. In the 1990s, he told a researcher that he remembered seeing an electric arc jump between the capsule and his pole right before the hatch blew.[33]Jim Lewis, the pilot of Grissom's rescue helicopter, toldSmithsonian Magazinethat closer inspection of film footage made him remember the day in better detail. He recalled that "Reinhard must have cut the antenna a mere second or two before I got us in a position for him to attach our harness to the capsule lifting bale," indicating that the timing of the helicopter's approach aligned with the static discharge theory.[34]

Project Gemini
In early 1964,Alan Shepardwas grounded after being diagnosed withMénière's diseaseand Grissom was designated command pilot forGemini 3, the first crewedProject Geminiflight, which flew on March 23, 1965.[22]This mission made Grissom the first human and thus firstNASA astronautto fly into space twice.[35]The two-man flight on Gemini 3 with Grissom andJohn W. Youngmade three revolutions of the Earth and lasted for 4 hours, 52 minutes and 31 seconds.[36]Grissom was one of the eight pilots of the NASAparaglider research vehicle(Paresev).[37]
Grissom, the shortest of the original seven astronauts at five feet seven inches tall, worked very closely with the engineers and technicians fromMcDonnell Aircraftwho built the Gemini spacecraft. Because of his involvement in the design of the first three spacecraft, his fellow astronauts humorously referred to the craft as "the Gusmobile". By July 1963 NASA discovered 14 out of its 16 astronauts could not fit themselves into the cabin and the later cockpits were modified.[38][39]During this time Grissom invented the multi-axistranslationthruster controller used to push the Gemini and Apollo spacecraft in linear directions forrendezvous and docking.[40]
In a joking nod to the sinking of his Mercury craft, Grissom named the first Gemini spacecraftMolly Brown(after the popular Broadway show,The Unsinkable Molly Brown).[22]Some NASA publicity officials were unhappy with this name and asked Grissom and his pilot,John Young, to come up with a new one. When they offeredTitanicas an alternate,[22]NASA executives decided to allow them to use the name ofMolly Brownfor Gemini 3, but did not use it in official references. Much to the agency's chagrin,CAPCOMGordon Coopergave Gemini 3 its sendoff on launch with the remark to Grissom and Young, "You're on your way,Molly Brown!" Ground controllers also used it to refer to the spacecraft throughout its flight.[41]
After the safe return of Gemini 3, NASA announced new spacecraft would not be nicknamed. Hence,Gemini 4was not calledAmerican Eagleas its crew had planned. The practice of nicknaming spacecraft resumed in 1967, when managers realized that theApolloflights needed a name for each of two flight elements, theCommand Module(CSM) and theLunar Module. Lobbying by the astronauts and senior NASA administrators also had an effect.Apollo 9used the nameGumdropfor the Command Module andSpiderfor the Lunar Module.[42]However, Wally Schirra was prevented from naming hisApollo 7spacecraftPhoenixin honor of theApollo 1crew because some believed that its nickname as a metaphor for "fire" might be misunderstood.[43]

Apollo program
Grissom was backup command pilot forGemini 6Awhen he was transferred to theApollo programand was assigned as commander of the first crewed mission,AS-204, with Senior PilotEd White, who had flown in space on the Gemini 4 mission, when he became the first American to make aspacewalk, and PilotRoger B. Chaffee.[22]The three men were granted permission to refer to their flight as "Apollo 1" on their mission insignia patch.
Problems with the simulator proved extremely annoying to Grissom, who told a reporter the problems with Apollo 1 came "in bushelfuls" and that he was skeptical of its chances to complete its fourteen-day mission.[44]Grissom earned the nickname "Gruff Gus" by being outspoken about the technical deficiencies of the spacecraft.[45]The engineers who programmed the Apollo training simulator had a difficult time keeping the simulator in sync with the continuous changes being made to the spacecraft. According to backup astronautWalter Cunningham, "We knew that the spacecraft was, you know, in poor shape relative to what it ought to be. We felt like we could fly it, but let's face it, it just wasn't as good as it should have been for the job of flying the first crewed Apollo mission."[22]
NASA pressed on. In mid-January 1967, "preparations were being made for the final pre-flight tests of Spacecraft 012."[22]On January 22, 1967, before returning toCape Kennedyto conduct the January 27 plugs-out test that ended his life, Grissom's wife, Betty, later recalled that he took a lemon from a tree in his back yard and explained that he intended to hang it on that spacecraft, although he actually hung the lemon on the simulator (a duplicate of the Apollo spacecraft).[46][47]

Personal life
Grissom metBetty Lavonne Moore(1927–2018), in high school.[48]They were married on July 6, 1945, at First Baptist Church in Mitchell when he was home on leave duringWorld War II. The couple had two sons, Scott (1950), and Mark (1953).[49][50]
Two of Grissom's pastimes were hunting and fishing. The family also enjoyed water sports and skiing.[51]

Death
Before Apollo 1's planned launch on February 21, 1967, the Command Module interior caught fire and burned on January 27, 1967, during a pre-launch test onLaunch Pad 34 at Cape Kennedy. Astronauts Grissom, White, and Chaffee, who were working inside the closed Command Module, were asphyxiated. During the test, Grissom said, "How are we going to get to the Moon if we can't talk between two or three buildings," then shouted "fire!"[52]The fire's ignition source was damaged wiring.[53]The pilots' deaths were attributed to lethal hazards in the early CSM design and conditions of the test, including a pressurized 100 percentoxygenprelaunch atmosphere, wiring and plumbing flaws, flammable materials used in the cockpit and in the astronauts' flight suits, and an inward-opening hatch that could not be opened quickly in an emergency and not at all with full internal pressure.[54]
Grissom's funeral services and burial atArlington National Cemeterywere held on January 31, 1967. Dignitaries in attendance included PresidentLyndon B. Johnson, members of theU.S. Congress, and fellow NASA astronauts, among others. Grissom was interred atArlington National Cemetery, inArlington County, Virginia,[55]beside Roger Chaffee.[56]White's remains are interred at theU.S. Military AcademyatWest Point, New York.[57]

Legacy
After the accident, NASA decided to give the flight the official designation of Apollo 1 and skip to Apollo 4 for the first uncrewed flight of the Saturn V, counting the two uncrewed suborbital tests,AS-201and202, as part of the sequence. The Apollo spacecraft problems were corrected, withApollo 7, commanded byWally Schirra, launched on October 11, 1968, more than a year and a half after the Apollo 1 accident. The Apollo program reached its objective of successfully landing men on the Moon on July 20, 1969, withApollo 11.[58][59]
At the time of his death, Grissom had attained the rank oflieutenant coloneland had logged a total of 4,600 hours flying time, including 3,500 hours injet airplanes.[19]Some contend that Grissom could have been selected as one of the astronauts to walk on the Moon.Deke Slaytonwrote that he had hoped for one of the original Mercury astronauts to go to the Moon, noting: "It wasn't just a cut-and-dried decision as to who should make the first steps on the Moon. If I had to select on that basis, my first choice would have been Gus, which bothChris KraftandBob Gilruthseconded."[60]Ultimately,Alan Shepard, one of the original seven NASA astronauts, would receive the honor of commanding theApollo 14lunar landing.[61]

Liberty Bell 7spacesuit controversy
When theU.S. Astronaut Hall of Fameopened in 1990, his family lent it thespacesuitworn by Grissom duringMercury 4along with other personal artifacts belonging to the astronaut. In 2002, the museum went into bankruptcy and was taken over by a NASA contractor, whereupon the family sought the exhibit's return.[62]All the artifacts were returned to them except the spacesuit, which NASA claimed was government property.[63]NASA insisted Grissom got authorization to use the spacesuit for ashow and tellat his son's school in 1965 and never returned it, but some of Grissom's family members claimed the astronaut rescued the spacesuit from a scrap heap.[64]As of December 2016,[update]the space suit was part of the Kennedy Space Center Hall of Fame's Heroes and Legends exhibit.[65]

Awards and honors
 - John J. Montgomery Award[67]: 465
To celebrate his spaceflight in 1961, Grissom was made honorary Mayor ofNewport News, Virginia, and a new library was dubbed the Virgil I. Grissom Library in the Denbigh section of Newport News, Virginia.[68]
The airport in Bedford, Indiana, where Grissom flew as a teenager was renamed Virgil I. Grissom Municipal Airport in 1965. A three-ton piece of limestone, inscribed with his name, was unveiled at the airport. His fellow astronauts ribbed him about the name, saying that airports were normally named for dead aviators. Grissom replied, "But this time they've named one for a live one."[69]Virgil Grissom Elementary School in Old Bridge, New Jersey, was named for Grissom the year before his death.[70]His death forced the cancellation of a student project to design a flag to represent Grissom and their school, which would have flown on the mission.[71]
Grissom was awarded theNASA Distinguished Service Medalfor his Mercury flight and was awarded it a second time for his role in Gemini 3.[72]The Apollo 1 crew was awarded the medal posthumously in a 1969 presentation of thePresidential Medal of Freedomto the Apollo 11 crew.[73]
Grissom's family received theCongressional Space Medal of Honorin 1978 from President Carter (White's and Chaffee's families received it in 1997).[74]
Grissom was granted an honorary doctorate fromFlorida Institute of Technologyin 1962, the first-ever awarded by the university.[75]Grissom was inducted into theInternational Space Hall of Famein 1981,[76][77]and theNational Aviation Hall of Famein 1987.[78]Grissom was posthumously inducted into theU.S. Astronaut Hall of Famein 1990.[79][80]His wife,Betty Lavonne Moore, donated his Congressional Space Medal of Honor to the accompanying museum.[81]
Grissom posthumously received AIAA's Haley Astronautics Award for 1968.[82]

Memorials
If we die, we want people to accept it. We are in a risky business and we hope that if anything happens to us it will not delay the program. The conquest of space is worth the risk of life.
The dismantledLaunch Pad 34atCape Canaveral Air Force Stationbears two memorial plaques to the crew of Apollo 1.[84]The Kennedy Space Center features a memorial exhibit honoring the Apollo 1 crew in theApollo/Saturn V Center, which includes artifacts and personal mementos of Grissom, Chaffee, and White. Grissom's name is included on the plaque left on the Moon with theFallen Astronautstatue in 1971 by the crew ofApollo 15.[85]
The Grissom Memorial, a 44-foot (13 m) talllimestonemonument representing the Redstone rocket and his Mercury space capsule was dedicated in downtown Mitchell, Indiana, in 1981.[86]The Virgil I. Grissom Memorial inSpring Mill State Park, near Grissom's hometown of Mitchell, Indiana, was dedicated in 1971, the tenth anniversary of his Mercury flight.[86][87]The governor declared it a state holiday for the second year in a row.[88]TheGus Grissom Stakesis a thoroughbred horse race run in Indiana each fall; originally held atHoosier ParkinAnderson, it was moved toHorseshoe IndianapolisinShelbyvillein 2014.[66]

His widow and son were invited to the dedication ceremony and planted the first large tree in the park.[92]Grissom is named with his Apollo 1 crewmates on theSpace Mirror Memorial, which was dedicated in 1991. His son, Gary Grissom, said, "When I was younger, I thought NASA would do something. It's a shame it has taken this long".[93][94]
Navi(Ivanspelled backwards), is a seldom-used nickname for the starGamma Cassiopeiae. Grissom used this name, plus two others for White and Chaffee, on his Apollo 1 mission planning star charts as a joke, and the succeeding Apollo astronauts kept using the names as a memorial.[95][96]Grissom crateris one of several located on the far side of the Moon named for Apollo astronauts. The name was created and used unofficially by the Apollo 8 astronauts and was adopted as the official name by the International Astronomical Union (IAU) in 1970.[97][98]2161 Grissomis amain belt asteroidthat was discovered in 1963 and officially designated in 1981.[99]The name references his launch date of July 21, 1961.[100]Grissom Hill, one of theApollo 1 HillsonMarswas named by NASA on January 27, 2004, the 37th anniversary of the Apollo 1 fire.[101][102]

During the dedication ceremony, his son said, "Of all the honors he won, none would please him more than this one today."[103]In 1994, it was again renamed toGrissom Air Reserve Basefollowing the USAF's realignment program.[104]The three-letter identifier of theVHF Omni Directional Radio Range(VOR) located atGrissom Air Reserve Baseis GUS. In 2000, classes of theUnited States Air Force Academybegan selecting aClass Exemplarwho embodies the type of person they strive to be. The class of 2007 selected Grissom.[105]An academic building was renamed Grissom Hall in 1968 at the formerChanute Air Force Base, Rantoul, Illinois, whereMinuteman missilemaintenance training was conducted. It was one of five buildings renamed for deceased Air Force personnel.[106][107]
The Virgil I. Grissom Museum, dedicated in 1971 by GovernorEdgar Whitcomb,[108]is located just inside the entrance toSpring Mill State Parkin Mitchell, Indiana.[109]TheMolly Brownwas transferred to be displayed in the museum in 1974.[110]His boyhood home in Mitchell, Indiana, is located on Grissom Avenue. The street was renamed in his honor after his Mercury flight.[111][112]
