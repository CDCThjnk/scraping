Andrew Sydney Withiel Thomas,AO(born 18 December 1951) is an Australian and Americanaerospace engineerand a formerNASAastronaut. He has dual nationality;[1]he became a U.S. citizen in December 1986, hoping to gain entry to NASA's astronaut program.[2]He is married to fellow NASA astronautShannon Walker.

Education
Thomas went to St Andrews Primary School, Adelaide at Walkerville in South Australia and subsequently toSt Peter's College, Adelaide. After secondary school, he studied at theUniversity of Adelaide, where he received aBEngdegree withFirst Class Honoursin 1973 and aPhDdegree in 1978, both in Mechanical Engineering.[3][4]
He appears in the 1972 edition of the Adelaide University Engineering Society's (AUES) annual publication,Hysteresis. The caption below a photograph of the 21-year-old Thomas reads:
A.S.W. (Syd) Thomas: Hides his massive intellect behind a screen of silence and hair. His abilities are varied and include designing wine labels for the A.U.E.S.
— Hysteresis 2000
, pg 27[5]
He is the great-great-grandson ofFrederick George Waterhouse, first curator of theSouth Australian Institute Museum, and naturalist of the John McDouallStuart Expedition 1861–1862.[6]

Early career
As a child, growing up inFullarton,Adelaide, Thomas was fascinated by space. His father has described how he started buildingmodel rocketsfrom cardboard and plastics.[3]After completing his studies, Thomas accepted an offer fromLockheedinAtlanta.  By 1990 he was the organisation's principal aerodynamic scientist.[3]His career continued in the field, steering towards more senior research positions.

NASA career
Thomas was selected by NASA in March 1992 and reported to theJohnson Space Centerin August 1992. In August 1993, following one year of training, he was appointed a member of theNASA Astronaut Corpsand was qualified for an assignment as a mission specialist onSpace Shuttleflight crews.
While awaiting space flight assignment, Thomas supported shuttle launch and landing operations as an Astronaut Support Person (ASP) at theKennedy Space Center. He also provided technical support to the Space Shuttle Main Engine project, the Solid Rocket Motor project and the External Tank project at theMarshall Space Flight Center. In June 1995, Thomas was named as payload commander for STS-77 and flew his first flight in space onEndeavourin May 1996.  AlthoughPaul D. Scully-Powerhad entered orbit as an oceanographer in 1985, Thomas was the first Australia-born professional astronaut to enter space.[3]
He next trained at theGagarin Cosmonaut Training CenterinStar City, Russia, in preparation for a long-duration flight. In 1998, he served as Board Engineer 2 aboard the Russian Space Station Mir for 140 days. From August 2001 to November 2003, Thomas served as DeputyChief of the Astronaut Office. Thomas completed his fourth space flight on STS-114 and has logged over 177 days in space. He worked on issues for the Exploration Branch of the Astronaut Office until his retirement from NASA in February 2014.
NASA officially announced Thomas' retirement on 20 June 2014, which took effect on 1 March 2014, after 22 years with the space agency.

Spaceflights
STS-77was a mission during which the crew deployed two satellites, tested a large inflatable space structure in orbit and conducted a variety of scientific experiments in a Spacehab laboratory module carried inEndeavour'spayload bay. The flight was launched from the Kennedy Space Center on 19 May 1996 and completed 160 orbits 153 nautical miles (283 km) above the Earth while traveling 4.1 million miles and logging 240 hours and 39 minutes in space.
On 22 January 1998, Thomas launched aboard Space ShuttleEndeavouras part of theSTS-89crew to dock with theMir Space Station. He served aboardMiras flight engineer 2 and returned to Earth with the crew ofSTS-91aboard Space ShuttleDiscoveryon 12 June 1998, completing 130 days in space and 2,250 orbits of Earth.[7]
STS-102Discovery(8–21 March 2001) was the eighth Shuttle mission to visit theInternational Space Stationand Thomas's third flight. Mission accomplishments included the delivery of the Expedition 2 crew and logistics resupply with theLeonardo Multi-Purpose Logistics Module, and then the return to Earth of the Expedition 1 crew. During the mission, Thomas performed an EVA of 6.5 hours to install components to the outside of the space station. The mission duration was 307 hours and 49 minutes.
STS-114Discovery(26 July – 9 August 2005) was the Return to Flight mission following theColumbiaaccidentduring which the crew continued the assembly of the International Space Station. Thomas tested and evaluated new procedures for flight safety and inspection and repair techniques for the Shuttle's thermal protection system. After a 2-week, 5.8 million mile journey in space, the orbiterDiscoveryand its crew returned to land atEdwards Air Force Base,California. The mission duration was 333 hours, 32 minutes, 48 seconds.

Post-NASA career
On 20 November 2020, theAndy Thomas Foundationwas launched. The purpose was to advance space education, raise awareness, and contribute to the Australian space community.[8]
