Haise also served as a tactics and all-weatherflight instructorin the U.S. Navy Advanced Training Command atNAS Kingsville,Texas.[3]
Haise has accumulated 9,300 hours flying time, including 6,200 hours injets.[3]
After his military service, Haise returned to school and graduated with aBachelor of Sciencedegree with honors inaeronautical engineeringfrom theUniversity of Oklahomain 1959, concurrently serving for two years in theOklahoma Air National Guard, as a fighter interceptor pilot with the185th Fighter Interceptor Squadron,[6]flying theF-86D.He then worked for the newly createdNational Aeronautics and Space Administration(NASA), first as a research pilot at theLewis Research CenternearCleveland. HisAir National Guardunit was called up during theBerlin Crisis of 1961and he served ten months as a fighter pilot in theUnited States Air Force.[7]He was a tactical fighter pilot and chief of the 164th Standardization-Evaluation Flight of the164th Tactical Fighter SquadronatMansfield Lahm Air National Guard Base,Ohio,[3]flying theF-84F.
Haise completed post-graduate courses at theU.S. Air Force Aerospace Research Pilot School(Class 64A) atEdwards Air Force Base,Californiain 1964, and attended the six-weekHarvard Business School'sAdvanced Management Programin 1972.[3]

NASA career
In 1966, Haise was one of 19 astronauts selected forNASA Astronaut Group 5.[8]He had already worked with NASA for several years as a civilian research pilot. He was the first astronaut in his group to be assigned to a mission, serving as backup Lunar Module Pilot for bothApollo 8andApollo 11.[3]

Apollo 13
It only seems interesting to the public if it's the first exploration of another planetary body, or if you're having a problem.
According to the rotation of crews during Apollo, Haise was originally assigned as Lunar Module Pilot forApollo 14, but his crew was switched to Apollo 13 so thatAlan Shepardcould have more training time. He flew as Lunar Module Pilot on the abortedApollo 13lunar mission in 1970.[10]Due to the distance between the Earth and Moon during the mission, Haise,Jim Lovell, andJack Swigerthold the record for the farthest distance from the Earth ever traveled by human beings.[11][12]Haise and Jack Swigert were the first people from Group 5 to fly in space. During this flight Haise developed aurinary tract infectionand later kidney infections. These caused him to be in pain for most of the trip.[13]
Haise was slated to become the 6th human to walk on the Moon during Apollo 13 behind Lovell, who was to be 5th.[14]Alan ShepardandEdgar Mitchelleventually became the fifth and sixth, respectively, onApollo 14, which completed Apollo 13's mission to theFra Mauro formation.[15]
Haise later served as backup commander forApollo 16. Though there was no formal selection, Haise was prospectively slated to commandApollo 19withWilliam R. Pogueas Command Module Pilot andGerald P. Carras Lunar Module Pilot. However, the mission was canceled in 1970 due to budget cuts.[16]

Space Shuttle approach and landing tests
After completing his backup assignment on Apollo 16, Haise moved to theSpace Shuttle program. In 1977, he participated in the program'sApproach and Landing Tests(ALT) atEdwards Air Force Base.[2][17][18]Along withC. Gordon Fullertonas pilot, Haise as commander piloted theSpace ShuttleEnterprisein free flight to three landings after being released from theShuttle Carrier Aircraft.[19][20][21]The tests verified the shuttle's flight characteristics, an important step toward the success of the program.[3]
Haise was assigned to commandSTS-2A, withJack R. Lousmaas pilot, the second Space Shuttle mission, which would have delivered theTeleoperator Retrieval Systemthat would have boostedSkylabto a higher orbit, preserving it for future use. Delays in the Shuttle program development as well as an unexpected increase in Skylab's orbital decay led to the mission being canceled. Skylab was destroyed upon entering the Earth's atmosphere in July 1979, while the Space Shuttle did not launch until April 1981.[22]
In June 1979, Haise left NASA to become a test pilot andexecutivewithGrumman Aerospace Corporation, where he remained until retiring in 1996.[23]He was the only one of the four astronauts who conducted theEnterpriselanding tests not to fly in space on the Shuttle.

Personal life
Haise has four children with his first wife Mary Griffin Grant, whom he married on June 4, 1954, and divorced on July 21, 1978.[3]He married Frances Patt Price, on January 9, 1979.[24]On February 7, 2022, Frances died.[25]
On August 22, 1973, Haise was piloting aConvair BT-13belonging to theCommemorative Air Forcethat had been converted to look like anAichi D3A"Val" torpedo bomber for the 1970 filmTora! Tora! Tora!. While attempting a landing go around atScholes FieldinGalveston, Texas, an undetermined power plant failure led to a crash landing. Haise sufferedsecond‐degree burnsover 50 percent of his body in the post crash fire.[26][27][28]
In 2022, Haise published his autobiography,Never Panic Early, about his life and experiences in the Apollo program.[29]
