Richard Alan "Rick" Searfoss(June 5, 1956 – September 29, 2018) was an American aviator who wasUnited States Air Forcecolonel,NASAastronautandtest pilot.[1]

Early life
Searfoss was born on June 5, 1956, inMount Clemens, Michigan, but had consideredPortsmouth, New Hampshire, to be his hometown.[2]Growing up, he became anEagle Scout.
After graduating from Portsmouth Senior High School,Portsmouth, New Hampshirein 1974, he received aBachelor of Sciencedegree inAeronautical Engineeringfrom theUnited States Air Force Academyin 1978, and aMaster of Sciencedegree inAeronauticsfrom theCalifornia Institute of Technologyon aNational Science FoundationFellowship in 1979. In the Air Force, he attendedSquadron Officer School,Air Command and Staff College, andAir War College.

Air Force service
Searfoss graduated in 1980 fromUndergraduate Pilot TrainingatWilliams Air Force Base,Arizona. From 1981 to 1984, he flew theF-111Foperationally atRAF Lakenheath, England, followed by a tour atMountain Home Air Force Base,Idaho, where he was anF-111Ainstructor pilotandweapons officeruntil 1987. In 1988 he attended theU.S. Naval Test Pilot School,Patuxent River, Maryland, as a USAF exchange officer. He was a flight instructor at theU.S. Air Force Test Pilot SchoolatEdwards Air Force Base,California, when selected for the astronaut program.
He has logged over 6,000 hours flying time in 77 different types of aircraft and over 939 hours in space. He also holds FAA Airline Transport Pilot, glider, and flight instructorratings.

NASA career
Selected byNASAin January 1990, Searfoss became an astronaut in July 1991. Initially assigned to the Astronaut Office Mission Support Branch, Searfoss was part of a team responsible for crew ingress/strap-in prior to launch and crew egress after landing. He was subsequently assigned to flight software verification in theShuttle Avionics Integration Laboratory(SAIL). Additionally, he served as the Astronaut Office representative for both flight crew procedures and Shuttle computer software development. He also served as the Astronaut Office Vehicle System and Operations Branch Chief, leading a team of several astronauts and support engineers working onSpace ShuttleandInternational Space Stationsystems development, rendezvous and landing/rollout operations, and advanced projects initiatives.
Searfoss served asSTS-58pilot on the seven-person life science research mission aboard theSpace Shuttle Columbia, launching from theKennedy Space Centeron October 18, 1993, and landing atEdwards Air Force Baseon November 1, 1993. The crew performed neurovestibular, cardiovascular, cardiopulmonary, metabolic, and musculoskeletal medical experiments on themselves and 48 rats, expanding our knowledge of human and animal physiology both on earth and in space flight. In addition, the crew performed 16 engineering tests aboard the Orbiter Columbia and 20 Extended Duration Orbiter Medical Project experiments. The mission was accomplished in 225 orbits of the Earth.
Searfoss flew his second mission as pilot ofSTS-76aboard the Space Shuttle Atlantis, which launched at night on March 22, 1996. During this 9-day mission the STS-76 crew performed the third docking of an American spacecraft with the Russian space stationMir. In support of a joint U.S./Russian program, the crew transported to Mir nearly two tons of water, food, supplies, and scientific equipment, as well as U.S. AstronautShannon Lucidto begin her six-month stay in space. STS-76 included the first-ever spacewalk on a combined Space Shuttle-Space Station complex. The flight crew also conducted scientific investigations, including European Space Agency sponsored biology experiments, theKidsatearth observations project, and several engineering flight tests. Completed in 145 orbits, STS-76 landed atEdwards Air Force Base, California, on March 31, 1996.
Searfoss commanded a seven-person crew on theSTS-90Neurolab mission which launched on April 17, 1998. During the 16-daySpacelabflight the crew served as both experiment subjects and operators for 26 individual life science experiments focusing on the effects of microgravity on the brain and nervous system. STS-90 was the last and most complex of the twenty-five Spacelab missions NASA has flown. Neurolab's scientific results will have broad applicability both in preparing for future long duration human space missions and in clinical applications on Earth. Completed in 256 orbits, STS-90 landed atKennedy Space Center, Florida, on May 3, 1998.
A veteran of three space flights, Searfoss logged over 39 days in space.  He retired from the Air Force and left NASA in 1998.  He became a commercial transport pilot for Southwest Airlines for a brief period and then returned to the space program by serving as the chief of safety for United Space Alliance at Kennedy Space Center.  For the next few years, he continued to work as a contract research test pilot at NASA'sDryden Flight Research Center.  For the year and a half immediately prior to his death, he was a T-38 instructor pilot at Edwards Air Force Base.

Civilian space
After leaving NASA, Searfoss served as a judge for theAnsari X-Prize, where he officially declaredSpaceShipOneto have won the competition on October 4, 2004, after completing two flights within a two-week period.[citation needed]
Searfoss was a test pilot instructor at theNational Test Pilot Schoolat theMojave Spaceport.[3]
In 2008, he was a featured guest in aVolkswagencommercial, where he argued with a blackBeetleabout who has more engineers between Volkswagen and NASA.[citation needed]
From the mid-2000s until the company closed, Searfoss worked withXCOR Aerospacein the development of their rocket-powered aircraft. As of September 2013[update], he was Chief Test Pilot at XCOR.[4]He flew the flight tests andenvelope expansionof theEZ-Rocket.  He also served as XCOR's only test pilot for a rocket-powered prototype racing aircraft. He made a total of 52 rocket-powered flights and was the world's only tri-qualified rocket pilot (Space Shuttle, EZ Rocket, Rocket Racer prototype).[citation needed]
