Nikolai Nikolayevich Rukavishnikov(Russian:Никола́й Никола́евич Рукави́шников; 18 September 1932 – 19 October 2002[1]) was aSovietcosmonautwho flew threespace missionsof theSoyuz programme:Soyuz 10,Soyuz 16, andSoyuz 33. Two of these missions, Soyuz 10 and Soyuz 33, were intended to dock withSalyutspace stations, but failed to do so.

Biography
Rukavishnikov studied at theMoscow Engineering and Physics Instituteand after graduation worked forSergey Korolev's design bureau. He was selected for cosmonaut training in 1967.
Rukavishnikov became the 50th human to fly in space on 23 April 1971, the launch date ofSoyuz 10. The mission, along withVladimir ShatalovandAleksei Yeliseyev, was intended to dock with theSalyut 1space station. They were unable to dock, and returned to Earth two days later.
He began his second flight,Soyuz 16, on 2 December 1974, withAnatoly Filipchenko. The mission was a test of the Soyuz 7K-TM hardware being used in theApollo–Soyuz Test Project. The mission lasted six days, and was a complete success.
His third flight,Soyuz 33, was anIntercosmosflight to theSalyut 6space station on 10 April 1979 withBulgariancosmonautGeorgi Ivanov. On its final approach, the spacecraft's main engine failed, and the docking was aborted. They were able to return to Earth with the backup engine, but an overly-long re-entry burn led to a 10-gballistic re-entry. The crew was recovered safely.
Rukavishnikov resigned from the space programme in 1987, and returned to work for the same bureau he started with, by then known as Energia.
He died of a heart attack on 19 October 2002.[1]
