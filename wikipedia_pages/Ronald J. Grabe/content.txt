Ronald John Grabe(born June 13, 1945) is a formerNASAastronaut and retiredUnited States Air Forcecolonel.
He has earned the Air ForceDistinguished Flying Cross, theAir Medalwith 7 Oak Leaf Clusters, theAir Force Meritorious Service Medal, theLiethen-Tittle Award(for Outstanding Student at the USAF Test Pilot School), theRoyal Air Force Cross, theNASA Exceptional Service Medal, andNASA Space Flight Medals.

Education and early career
Grabe graduated fromStuyvesant High School(New York City) in 1962; earned aBachelor of Sciencedegree inEngineering Sciencefrom theUnited States Air Force Academyin 1966; and studiedAeronauticsas aFulbright Scholarat theTechnische Hochschule(Darmstadt,West Germany) in 1967.
He returned to the United States in 1967 to complete pilot training atRandolph Air Force Base,Texas. He subsequently flewF-100aircraft with the27th Tactical Fighter WingatCannon Air Force Base,New Mexico, and in 1969 was assigned as an F-100 pilot with the3d Tactical Fighter WingatBien Hoa Air Basein theRepublic of Vietnam, where he flew 200combat missions.
In 1970, he was reassigned to the 27th Tactical Fighter Wing at Cannon Air Force Base to fly F-100 andF-111aircraft. He participated in the operational test and evaluation of the weapons system of theF-111Daircraft. Grabe attended theUSAF Test Pilot Schoolin 1974 and, upon graduating in 1975, was assigned to the Air Force Flight Test Center as a test pilot for theA-7and F-111. He was the program manager and chief project pilot for the Air Force's digital flight control system for tactical fighters (DIGITAC) evaluation. He later served as an exchange test pilot with theRoyal Air ForceatBoscombe Down, United Kingdom, from 1976 to 1979. During this tour of duty, he served as the chief project pilot for the Royal Air Force Harrier and the Royal Navy Sea Harrier. He was an instructor at the USAF Test Pilot School atEdwards Air Force Base,California, when advised of his selection byNASA.
He has logged more than 5,500 hours flying time.

NASA experience
Grabe became a NASA astronaut in August 1981. He has served as a chief verification pilot forSTS-3andSTS-4entry guidance, navigation and control simulation testing; as the Deputy Manager for Operations Integration, Space Shuttle Program Office; and subsequently as the Chief of Training within theAstronaut Office. A veteran of four space flights, Grabe served as pilot onSTS-51-J(October 3–7, 1985) andSTS-30(May 4–8, 1989), and was the mission commander onSTS-42(January 22–30, 1992) andSTS-57(June 21 to July 1, 1993).
Grabe has logged over 627 hours inspace. Effective April 11, 1994, Grabe left NASA and the Air Force to join Orbital Sciences Corporation,Dulles, Virginia.

Space flight experience
STS-51-J, the second Space ShuttleDepartment of Defensemission, launched from Kennedy Space Center, Florida, on October 3, 1985. This was the maiden voyage of the Atlantis, the final Orbiter in the Shuttle fleet. After 98 hours of orbital operations, Atlantis landed at Edwards Air Force Base, California, on October 7, 1985. Mission duration was 97 hours, 14 minutes, 38 seconds.
STS-30Atlantis launched fromKennedy Space Center, Florida, on May 4, 1989. During the four-day mission, the crew successfully deployed theMagellanVenus-exploration spacecraft, the first U.S. planetary science mission launched since 1978, and the first planetary probe to be deployed from the Shuttle. Magellan arrived atVenusin mid-1990, and mapped over 95% of the surface of Venus. Magellan has been one of NASA's most successful scientific missions and continues to operate today gaining information about the Venetian atmosphere and magnetic field. In addition, crew members also worked on secondary payloads involving fluid research in general, chemistry, and electrical storm studies. Following 64 orbits of the Earth, the STS-30 mission concluded with a landing at Edwards Air Force Base, California, on May 8, 1989. Mission duration was 96 hours, 57 minutes, 35 seconds.
STS-42Discovery launched from the Kennedy Space Center, Florida, on January 22, 1992. Fifty-five major experiments conducted in the International Microgravity Laboratory-1 module were provided by investigators from eleven countries, and represented a broad spectrum of scientific disciplines. During 128 orbits of the Earth, the seven-person crew accomplished the mission's primary objective of investigating the effects ofmicrogravityon materials processing and life sciences. In this unique laboratory in space, the crew worked around-the-clock in two shifts. Experiments investigated the microgravity effects on the growth of protein and semiconductor crystals. Biological experiments on the effects of zero gravity onplants,tissues,bacteria,insectsand human vestibular response were also conducted. This eight-day mission culminated in a landing at Edwards Air Force Base, California, on January 30, 1992. Mission duration was 193 hours, 14 minutes, 45 seconds.
STS-57Endeavour launched from the Kennedy Space Center, Florida, on June 21, 1993. The primary mission of this flight was the retrieval of the European Retrievable Carrier satellite (EURECA). Additionally, STS-57 featured the first flight of the Spacehab, a commercially provided middeck augmentation module for the conduct of microgravity experiments. Spacehab carried 22 individual flight experiments in materials processing and human factors. A spacewalk was conducted on this flight as part of an ongoing program to evaluate extravehicular activity (EVA) techniques for future missions. The Space Shuttle Endeavour landed at the Kennedy Space Center on July 1, 1993, after 10 days on orbit. Mission duration was 239 hours, 45 minutes.
He is married to the former Lynn O'Keefe of Ottawa, Canada. Ron has two daughters and he and Lynn have a son. Recreational interests include skiing, wind surfing, and racquet sports.
