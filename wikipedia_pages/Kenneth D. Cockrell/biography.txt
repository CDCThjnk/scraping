- STS-56 carrying ATLAS-2 was a nine-day mission aboard the Space Shuttle Discovery during which the crew conducted atmospheric and solar studies in order to better understand the effect of solar activity on the Earth's climate and environment. STS-56 launched April 8, 1993, and landed April 17, 1993. Mission duration was 9 days, 6 hours, 9 minutes, 21 seconds.
- STS-69 was a 10-day mission aboard the Space Shuttle Endeavour . The primary objective of STS-69 was the successful deployment and retrieval of a SPARTAN satellite and the Wake Shield Facility (WSF). The WSF was designed to evaluate the effectiveness of using a free-flying platform to grow semiconductors, high temperature superconductors and other materials using the ultra-high vacuum created behind the spacecraft. STS-69 launched September 7, 1995, and landed September 18, 1995. Mission duration was 10 days, 20 hours, 28 minutes.
- STS-80 was a 17-day mission aboard the Space Shuttle Columbia . During STS-80 the crew deployed and retrieved the Wake Shield Facility (WSF) and the Orbiting Retrievable Far and Extreme Ultraviolet Spectrometer (ORFEUS) satellites. The ORFEUS instruments, mounted on the reusable Shuttle Pallet Satellite , studied the origin and makeup of stars. STS-80 launched November 19, 1996, and landed December 7, 1996. Mission duration was a record-breaking 17 days, 15 hours, 53 minutes.
- STS-98 was a 12-day mission aboard the Space Shuttle Atlantis . The STS-98 crew continued the task of building and enhancing the International Space Station by delivering the U.S. laboratory module Destiny . The Shuttle spent seven days docked to the station while Destiny was attached, and three spacewalks were conducted to complete its assembly. The crew also relocated a docking port, and delivered supplies and equipment to the resident Expedition-1 crew. STS-98 launched February 7, 2001, and landed February 20, 2001. Mission duration was 12 days, 21 hours, 20 minutes. Unacceptable weather conditions in Florida necessitated a landing at Edwards Air Force Base, California.
- STS-111 was a 13-day mission aboard the Space Shuttle Endeavour . The STS-111 mission delivered a new ISS resident crew and a Canadian-built mobile base for the orbiting outpost's robotic arm. The crew also performed a late-notice repair of the station's robot arm by replacing one of the arm's joints. It was the second Space Shuttle mission dedicated to delivering research equipment to the space platform. STS-111 also brought home the Expedition-Four crew from their 6 + 1 ⁄ 2 -month stay aboard the station. STS-111 launched June 5, 2002, and landed June 19, 2002. Mission duration was 13 days, 20 hours and 35 minutes. Unacceptable weather conditions in Florida necessitated a landing at Edwards Air Force Base, California.
- Cockrells awards include the National Defense Service Medal , Naval Aviator Badge , and the Naval Astronaut Badge .
- Cockrell has two children and lives in Friendswood, Texas . His recreational interests include: sport flying, snow and water skiing. He was also called Taco by his fellow astronauts.
