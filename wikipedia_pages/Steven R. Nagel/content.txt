With the completion of his fourth flight, Nagel had logged a total of 723 hours inspace. Nagel retired from the Air Force, effective February 28, 1995. He retired from the Astronaut Office, effective March 1, 1995, to assume the full-time position of Deputy Director for Operations Development, Safety, Reliability, and Quality Assurance Office,Johnson Space Center,Houston, Texas. In September 1996, Nagel transferred to Aircraft Operations Division where he performed duties as a Research Pilot. Nagel was a veteran of four space flights (STS-51-GandSTS-61-Ain 1985,STS-37in 1991, andSTS-55in 1993) as described below:

Spaceflight experience
Nagel first flew as amission specialiston STS-51G, which launched from theKennedy Space Center,Florida, on June 17, 1985. The crew aboard theShuttleDiscoverydeployed communications satellites forMexico(Morelos), theArab League(Arabsat), and the United States (AT&T Telstar). They used theRemote Manipulator System(RMS) to deploy and later retrieve theSPARTANsatellite which performed 17 hours ofx-rayastronomyexperiments while separated from the Space Shuttle. In addition, the crew activated the Automated Directional Solidification Furnace (ADSF), six "Getaway Specials," participated in biomedical experiments, and conducted a laser tracking experiment as part of theStrategic Defense Initiative. After completing approximately 170 hours of space flight,Discoverylanded atEdwards Air Force Base,California, on June 24, 1985.
Nagel then flew as pilot on STS-61A, the West German D-1 Spacelab mission, which launched from Kennedy Space Center, Florida, on October 30, 1985. This mission was the first in which payload activities were controlled from outside the United States. More than 75 scientific experiments were completed in the areas ofphysiological sciences,materials processing,biology, andnavigation. After completing 111 orbits of the Earth,ShuttleChallengerlanded atEdwards Air Force Base, Californiaon November 6, 1985.
On his third flight, Nagel was commander of STS-37, which launched into orbit on April 5, 1991, from Kennedy Space Center, Florida, and landed on April 11, 1991, atEdwards Air Force Base, California. During this mission, the crew aboard theShuttleAtlantisdeployed theCompton Gamma Ray Observatoryfor the purpose of exploring gamma ray sources throughout the universe. The crew and conducted the first scheduledspace walkin more than five and one-half years, and the first successful unscheduled spacewalk to free a stuck antenna on the satellite.
Nagel also served as commander of STS-55, the German D-2 Spacelab mission. After launching on April 26, 1993, on theShuttleColumbia; the crew landed 10 days later on May 6, 1993, at Edwards Air Force Base, California. During the ambitious mission 89 experiments were performed in many disciplines such as materials processing,life sciences,robotics,technology,astronomyand earth mapping.
In total, he logged 723 hours in space.[2]

Post-NASA career
In 2011, Nagel and his wife Linda moved to Columbia, Missouri, where they both were teaching at theUniversity of Missouri. Nagel was a retention specialist in theCollege of Engineeringand instructor in the Mechanical and Aerospace Engineering Department, specializing in aerospace propulsion; Godwin was a professor in the physics department, specializing in astronomy.
Specifically he worked at theUniversity of Missouri College of Engineering. There he served as an instructor in the university's Mechanical and Aerospace Engineering Department.[3]

Organizations
Life member of theOrder of DaedaliansandAlpha Delta Phi; and honorary member ofPhi Eta Sigma,Sigma Tau,Tau Beta Pi, andSigma Gamma Tau.

Special honors
Awarded the Air ForceDistinguished Flying Crossand the Air Medal with 7Oak Leaf Clusters; and forUndergraduate Pilot Training, recipient of the Commander's Trophy, the Flying Trophy, the Academic Trophy, and theOrville Wright Achievement Award(Order of Daedalians); also presented the Air ForceMeritorious Service Medal(1978).
