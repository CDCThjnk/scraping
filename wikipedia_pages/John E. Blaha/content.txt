Following graduation, he served as anF-104instructor pilot at the test pilot school, teaching low lift-to-drag approach, zoom, performance, stability/control, and spin flight test techniques. In 1973, he was assigned as atest pilotworking with theRoyal Air Forceat theAeroplane and Armament Experimental Establishment,Boscombe Down, United Kingdom. During a three-year tour, he flew stability/control, performance, spin, and weapons delivery flight tests in theSEPECAT Jaguar,Blackburn Buccaneer,BAE Hawk, andBAC Jet Provostaircraft. In 1976, he attended the U.S. Air ForceAir Command and Staff College. After graduation, he was assigned to work for the Assistant Chief of Staff, Studies and Analyses, at Headquarters USAF in thePentagon.

NASA
Selected as an astronaut in May 1980, Blaha has logged 161 days in space on five space missions.
In addition to flying five space missions, Blaha has served as the chairman, NASA Space Flight Safety Panel; weather manager, Mission Management Team; lead spacecraft communicator; member, NASA Space Shuttle Improvement Panel. Blaha also led the design, development, and integration of the Orbiter Head Up Display system. Additionally, he led the development of contingency abort procedures which significantly improve crew survivability in the event of multiple main engine failures during ascent. He has logged more than 7,000 hours of flying time in 34 different aircraft, and has written numerous technical articles on spacecraft performance and control.
Blaha retired from NASA in September 1997 to return to his hometown of San Antonio, Texas, where he joined the executive management team of theUnited Services Automobile Association.[3]

Space flights
STS-29 was a NASA Space Shuttle mission using theDiscovery. Launched on March 13, 1989,[4]from the Kennedy Space Center'sLaunch Complex 39B, its main objective was the deployment of the Tracking and Data Relay Satellite (TDRS-D).[5]: 2.30–2.31Blaha served as the pilot of the STS-29 mission, marking his first spaceflight.[4]In this role, Blaha supported the commander during the launch, orbit, and landing procedures. Additionally, he was involved in on-orbit operations.[6]
STS-33 was a NASA Space Shuttle mission involving theDiscovery. The shuttle was launched on November 23, 1989, from Launch Complex 39B.[5]: 2.35Blaha was chosen for this mission as a replacement forS. David Griggs, who died in an accident in June 1989. This marked the first crew substitution of its kind since the Apollo 13 mission.[5]: 2.35TheDiscoverycompleted its mission objectives and returned to Earth, landing on November 28, 1989, at Edwards Air Force Base on Runway 22.[7]
STS-43 was a shuttle mission aboard theAtlantis. The shuttle launched on August 2, 1991, fromLaunch Complex 39A.[8]One of the primary objectives of the mission was the deployment of the fifth Tracking and Data Relay Satellite, TDRS-E.[5]: 2.49Blaha served as the commander, marking his third mission to space[5]: 2.49and his first as commander. In addition to the deployment of TDRS-E,[9]the STS-43 crew conducted various secondary payloads and experiments, which contributed to advancements in a range of scientific fields.[9]TheAtlantissuccessfully concluded its mission by landing on August 11, 1991, at theShuttle Landing Facility.[8]
STS-58 was a shuttle mission utilizing theColumbia. The shuttle launched on October 18, 1993, fromLaunch Complex 39B.[10]Blaha served as the commander for this mission, marking his fourth journey to space.[5]: 2.69The mission's emphasis was on biomedical studies under theSpacelabLife Sciences (SLS-2) program. This program involved a comprehensive set of experiments to study the physiological effects of prolonged spaceflight.[11]With a duration of 14 days, 0 hours, 12 minutes, and 32 seconds, STS-58 became the longest mission of the Space Shuttle program.[5]TheColumbiacompleted its mission by landing on November 1, 1993, at 15:05:42 UTC at the Edwards Air Force Base, touching down on Runway 22.[10][5]
Blaha beganRussian languagetraining in August 1994 at theDefense Language InstituteinMonterey, California, and commenced an intensive training program at theGagarin Cosmonaut Training Center,Star City, Russia in January 1995. He launched onSTS-79on September 16, 1996. After docking he transferred to theMir Space Station. Assigned as a Board Engineer 2, he spent the following 4 months with the Mir 22Cosmonautcrew conductingmaterial science, fluid science, and life science research. Blaha returned to Earth aboardSTS-81on January 22, 1997.[12][13]
Blaha was not permitted to vote in theNovember 1996 election, because his mission onMirbegan before ballots were finalized and lasted beyond Election Day.[14]In 1997, Texas amended its election statutes to permit voting from space, as a result of his predicament.[14]
