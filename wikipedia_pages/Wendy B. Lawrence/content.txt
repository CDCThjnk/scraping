Selected byNASAin March 1992, Lawrence reported to theJohnson Space Centerin August 1992. She completed one year of training and was qualified for flight assignment as a mission specialist. Her technical assignments within the Astronaut Office have included flight software verification in theShuttle Avionics Integration Laboratory(SAIL), Astronaut Office Assistant Training Officer, and Astronaut Office representative for Space Station training and crew support. She flew as the ascent/entryflight engineerand blue shift orbit pilot onSTS-67(March 2–18, 1995). She next served as Director of Operations for NASA at theGagarin Cosmonaut Training CenterinStar City, Russia, with responsibility for the coordination and implementation of mission operations activities in theMoscowregion for the joint U.S./Russian Shuttle/Mir program. In September 1996 she began training as a crew member for a 4-month mission on the Russian Space StationMir. However, she was replaced byDavid Wolfdue to concerns over minimum size requirements for the RussianOrlanEVA suit. Because of her knowledge and experience with Mir systems and with crew transfer logistics for the Mir, she flew onSTS-86(September 25 to October 6, 1997) andSTS-91(June 2–12, 1998). A veteran of fourspace flights, she logged over 1,200 hours in space. Lawrence was a mission specialist on the crew ofSTS-114. She was in charge of the transfer of supplies and equipment and operated the Space Station robotic arm on the Return To Flight mission during which the crew tested and evaluated new procedures for the inspection and repair of theSpace Shuttle thermal protection system. The mission launched on July 26, 2005, and landed on August 9, 2005.[5][7][8][9][10][11]Captain Lawrence retired from NASA in June 2006.

Spaceflight experience
STS-67Endeavour(March 2–18, 1995) was the second flight of the ASTRO observatory, a unique complement of three telescopes. During this 16-day mission, the crew conducted observations around the clock to study the far ultraviolet spectra of faint astronomical objects and the polarization of ultraviolet light coming from hot stars and distant galaxies. Mission duration was 399 hours and 9 minutes.[12]
STS-86Atlantis(September 25 to October 6, 1997) was the seventh mission to rendezvous and dock with the Russian Space Station Mir. Highlights included the exchange of U.S. crew membersMike FoaleandDavid Wolf, a spacewalk byScott ParazynskiandVladimir Titovto retrieve four experiments first deployed on Mir during theSTS-76docking mission, the transfer to Mir of 10,400 pounds of science and logistics, and the return of experiment hardware and results to Earth. Mission duration was 169 orbits in 259 hours and 21 minutes.[13]
STS-91Discovery(June 2–12, 1998) was the 9th and final Shuttle-Mir docking mission and marked the conclusion of the joint U.S./Russian Phase I Program. Mission duration was 235 hours, 54 minutes.[14]
STS-114Discovery(July 26 – August 9, 2005) was the first "Return to Flight" mission following the Space ShuttleColumbiadisaster. Highlights included the first in-flight repair to the orbiter during aspacewalk.  Mission duration was 333 hours, 33 minutes.[15]
