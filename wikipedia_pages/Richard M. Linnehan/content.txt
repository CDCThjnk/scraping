Career
After graduating from The Ohio State University College of Veterinary Medicine in June 1985, Linnehan entered private veterinary practice and was later accepted to a two-year joint internship in zoo animal medicine and comparative pathology at theBaltimore ZooandJohns Hopkins University. After completing his internship, Linnehan was commissioned as acaptainin theU.S. Army Veterinary Corpsand reported for duty in early 1989 at theNaval Ocean Systems Center,San Diego, California, as chief clinical veterinarian for theU.S. Navy’sMarine Mammal Program. During his assignment at the Naval Ocean Systems Center, Linnehan initiated and supervised research in the areas ofcetaceanandpinnipedanesthesia,orthopedics, drugpharmacokineticsand reproduction in direct support of U.S. Navy mobile marine mammal systems stationed inCalifornia,Florida, andHawaii.

NASA career
Selected by NASA in March 1992, Linnehan reported to theJohnson Space Centerin August 1992 where he completed one year of astronaut candidate training, qualifying him forSpace Shuttleflight assignments as a mission specialist. Linnehan was initially assigned to flight software verification in theShuttle Avionics Integration Laboratory(SAIL). He was subsequently assigned to the Astronaut Office Mission Development Branch, working on payload development, and mission development flight support for future Space Shuttle missions. He first flew as a mission specialist in 1996 onSTS-78, the Life Sciences and Microgravity Spacelab (LMS) mission. In 1998, he served as the payload commander on theSTS-90Neurolab mission. In 2002, he was a member of the four-man EVA crew on STS-109 the fourth Hubble Space Telescope servicing mission. In 2008, he was the lead spacewalker on [(STS-123)] 1JA, an ISS assembly mission where he performed three EVAs and supervised the remaining two during the installation of the JEM module and Canadian SPDM. A veteran of four space flights, Linnehan has logged over 59 days in space, including six EVAs (spacewalks) totaling 42 hours and 11 minutes.[1]
As of 2020, Linnehan is a management astronaut and no longer eligible for NASA Space flight assignments. Dr. Linnehan splits his time between the Astronaut Office Exploration and Integration branches and the NASA Institutional Review Board (IRB) and JSC Institutional, and NASA Flight, Animal Care and Use Committees (IACUCs).[1]

Spaceflight experience
STS-78LMS (June 20 to July 7, 1996). The Life Sciences and Microgravity Spacelab mission was flown aboard Space ShuttleColumbia. The 17-day flight included studies sponsored by ten nations and five space agencies, and was the first mission to combine both a full microgravity studies agenda and a comprehensive life sciences payload. STS-78 orbited the Earth 271 times, and covered 7,000,000 miles (11,000,000 km) in 405 hours and 48 minutes.
STS-90Neurolab (April 17 to May 3, 1998) was Linnehan's secondSpacelabmission. During the 16-day flight the seven-person crew aboard Space ShuttleColumbiaserved as both experimental subjects and operators for 26 individual life science experiments focusing on the effects of microgravity on the brain and nervous system. STS-90 orbited the Earth 256 times, and covered 6,300,000 miles (10,100,000 km) in 381 hours and 50 minutes. Both missions served as a model for future life sciences studies on board theInternational Space Station.
STS-109HST Servicing Mission 3B (March 1 to March 12, 2002) was the fourthHubble Space Telescope(HST) servicing mission and Linnehan's third flight aboardColumbia. The crew of STS-109 successfully upgraded the Hubble Space Telescope's systems over the course of five consecutive EVAs, leaving it with a new power control unit, improved solar arrays, the new Advanced Camera for Surveys (ACS), and an experimental refrigeration unit for cooling the dormant Near Infrared Camera and Multi-Object Spectrometer (NICMOS). With his teammateJohn Grunsfeld, Linnehan performed three of the five spacewalks totaling 21 hours and 9 minutes. STS-109 orbited the Earth 165 times and covered 3,900,000 miles (6,300,000 km) in just over 262 hours.
STS-123(March 11 to March 26, 2008) was Linnehan's fourth spaceflight, and his first aboard the Space ShuttleEndeavour. The mission delivered the Japanese Logistics Module and the CanadianSpecial Purpose Dexterous Manipulatorto theInternational Space Station. Linnehan performed three of the five scheduled spacewalks on STS-123 withGarrett Reisman,Mike ForemanandBob Behnken.
