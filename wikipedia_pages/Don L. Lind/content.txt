Don Leslie Lind[1](May 18, 1930 – August 30, 2022) was an American scientist,naval officer,aviator, andNASAastronaut. He graduated from theUniversity of Utahwith an undergraduate degree in physics in 1953. Following his military service obligation, he earned a PhD inhigh-energy nuclear physicsfrom theUniversity of California, Berkeleyin 1964.
Lind was aNaval Aviatorand attained the rank of commander in theUnited States Naval Reserve. After completing his doctorate, Lind worked at NASA's Goddard Research Center from 1964 to 1966. Selected withAstronaut Group 5in 1966, he helped to develop the Apollo 11 EVA activities, and served as CAPCOM for theApollo 11andApollo 12missions. Lind was then assigned as backup pilot forSkylab 3andSkylab 4and would have flown onSkylab Rescue.
Lind was the payload commander on his only flight,STS-51-B, launched April 29, 1985. He designed an experiment to capture the Earth's aurora. The payload experiments consisted primarily of microgravity research and atmospheric measurement. TheOrbiterChallengercompleted 110 orbits before landing atEdwards Air Force Base, California.

Biography

Early life and education
Lind was born May 18, 1930, and raised inMidvale, Utah,[2][3]with his two sisters, Charlene and Kathleen. He attended Midvale Elementary School and graduated fromJordan High Schoolin 1948. He was anEagle Scoutwith theBoy Scouts of America, its highest rank.[4]He received aBachelor of Sciencedegree with high honors inphysicsfrom theUniversity of Utahin 1953.[1]
As aNaval Aviator, Lind volunteered to take high-altitudephoto emulsionsofcosmic raysfor theUniversity of California, Berkeleyduring flights. This helped him enroll at Berkeley,[5][6]where Lind researchedpion-nucleonscattering in theLawrence Radiation Laboratoryand earned a PhD inhigh-energy nuclear physicsin 1964.[1]During a leave of absence from NASA, he conducted postdoctoral research at theGeophysical Instituteof theUniversity of Alaska Fairbanksfrom 1975 to 1976.[7]

Navy service
Upon completing his undergraduate education, Lind was initially drafted by theUnited States Armyas a potentialinfantrymanamid theKorean War; following "expert maneuvering," he instead enrolled at theUnited States NavyOfficer Candidate SchoolatNewport, Rhode Island.[8]After jokingly requesting flight training, Lind was unable to change his assignment and found that he enjoyed flying.[9]He received hisWings of Goldin 1955 atNaval Air Station Corpus Christiand served four years on active duty with the Navy atSan Diegoand aboard the carrierUSSHancock. Lind logged more than 4,500 hours of flight time during his naval and NASA careers, 4,000 of which were injet aircraft.[1]He continued to serve in theUnited States Naval Reserveafter completing his service obligation, attaining his terminal rank ofcommanderin 1969.[10]

NASA career
From 1964 to 1966, Lind worked at the NASAGoddard Space Flight Centeras aspace physicist.[5]He was involved in experiments to determine the nature and properties of low-energy particles within the Earth'smagnetosphereandinterplanetary space. Lind applied for NASA'sthird group of astronautsbut did not have enough flight hours, and was too old for thefourth group[7]by 74 days, despite arguing that he would not have to learn to fly.[11]After the age restriction changed, he was among the fifth group, the "Original Nineteen", selected in April 1966.[6][12]
Lind was selected as a pilot with other "Original Nineteen" astronauts[11]in contrast to the fourth andsixthastronaut groups, which consisted of medical doctors and Ph.D. scientists who were not qualified pilots. However, he and Group 5 colleagueBruce McCandless II(the salutatorian of hisUnited States Naval Academyclass and the recent recipient of a master's degree inelectrical engineeringfromStanford University) were nonetheless treated as scientist-astronauts by NASA due to their academic training and lack oftest pilotexperience thatDeke Slayton,Al Shepardand other NASA managers emphasized; among other factors, this would delay their progression in the flight rotation.[7][13]
Along with geologist-astronautHarrison Schmitt, Lind helped to develop and demonstrate the flight plan for theApollo 11EVA (including the Apollo Lunar Surface Experiments Packages that would continue to relay data following the missions) and other tools used on thelunar surface.[5][14]He also served as acapsule communicatoron the Apollo 11 andApollo 12missions. Schmitt, Lind andOwen Garriottwere the only scientist-astronauts to receive advanced helicopter training, a key prerequisite for piloting theApollo Lunar Module.[15]Due to standard crew rotations, it is believed that Lind would have followed Schmitt as the second scientist-astronaut Lunar Module Pilot on one of thecanceled Apollo missionsor projected long-rangeApollo Applications Programlunar survey missions.[11][16]
Amid the gradual cancellation of the later Apollo missions and the devolution of the AAP into theSkylab program, Lind was formally reassigned to the latter effort in August 1969; according to Slayton, who noted Lind's disappointment, "with the cancellation of[Apollo] 20, I could see I just wasn't going to have a flight for him".[17]Together, Lind and Group 6 scientist-astronautWilliam B. Lenoircomprised the Earth Resources Group of the Skylab Branch Office.[10]
[On Skylab 3 and 4,] I was backing up two of the most depressingly healthy people you can imagine.[7]
Lind served as backup pilot alongside backup commanderVance D. Brandand backup science pilot Lenoir forSkylab 3andSkylab 4, the second and third crewed Skylab missions; was on standby for arescue missionplanned when malfunctions developed in Skylab 3'sApollo Command/Service Module(ultimately thwarted due to Brand and Lind's resourcefulness in devising a solution in the simulators) and the proposed 20-daySkylab 5mission (scrapped in favor of the more economical extension of Skylab 4 from 56 to 84 days); and may have flown as a pilot or science pilot onSkylab B.[7][18]
Astronauts knew little of why or how they were assigned to missions.[19][20]By the Skylab era, Lind was informally perceived as a "scientist-pilot" because of his doctorate.[21]According to David Shayler, Lind "could never understand why he was not on the [Skylab 4] crew as science pilot" due to his work on the mission's Earth resources package; this could be attributed in part to seniority and specialization, as all of the prime crew science pilots were drawn from Group 4. Additionally, Skylab 4 science pilotEdward Gibson(like Lind, an atmospheric physicist) had taken on a research program insolar physicsand worked on theApollo Telescope Mountwhile Lind was still on track to be assigned to a lunar mission.[11]Although he cross-trained with Lenoir and briefly proposed swapping positions with his crewmate, Lind elected to retain his original assignment due to the greater likelihood of the rescue mission (which could only accommodate the commander and pilot) amid the space program's dwindling flight opportunities.[18]
According toMichael Cassutt, in 1970, Lind "openly complained" toGeorge Abbey(then technical assistant toJohnson Space CenterdirectorRobert R. Gilruth) about the perceived administrative machinations of Slayton and Shepard and Harrison Schmitt's assignment to Apollo 17.[22]However, Abbey—a close friend of Schmitt who would eventually oversee Astronaut Corps assignments as director of flight operations from 1976 to 1988—took umbrage at Lind's cooperation with a 1969 report inThe Washington Postthat exposed rampant dissatisfaction among the scientist-astronauts. He also alleged that Lind complained about "any and all subjects" related to the space program, associating him with a coterie of scientist-astronauts (includingStory Musgrave) who perceived Abbey as a "faceless 'horse-holder' who had worked his way into a powerful job." Although Abbey could not forestall Lind's eventual flight, their acrimonious relationship played a key role in hindering the astronaut's progression in the flight rotation.[22]
When theSmithsonian Air and Space Museumreceived the unused Skylab B he "cried ceremonially in front of it", Lind later said; "I was ... in the right place at the wrong time".[23]He was reassigned to the Science and Applications Directorate in 1974, formally codifying his status as a scientist-astronaut.[10]In a 1976 memo,Chris Kraftimplicitly characterized Lind as one of NASA's nine active scientist-astronauts in the context of thepayload specialistprogram.[24]
For theSpace Shuttle program, Lind was reassigned as amission specialistalong with McCandless (who, unlike Lind, continued to train as a potentialSpace Shuttle orbiterpilot until 1983)[10]and the remaining Apollo-era scientist-astronauts. During this period, he was a member of theAstronaut Office's Operations Missions development group, responsible for developingpayloadsfor the early Space Shuttle Orbital Flight Test (OFT) missions and theCanadarm.[7]
Lind finally flew as the lead mission specialist and de facto payload commander onSTS-51-B(April 29 to May 6, 1985), logging over 168 hours in space. Due to Apollo-era managerial preferences, his contentious relationship with George Abbey, NASA budgetary problems and delays in the Space Shuttle program, Lind waited longer than any other continuously serving American astronaut for a spaceflight: 19 years.[6][7][25]STS-51-B's average age of 48.6 was the oldest for an American space mission.[19]
STS-51-B, theSpacelab-3science mission, launched fromKennedy Space Center, Florida, on April 29, 1985. Following several delays, this was the first fully operationalSpacelabmission. A space program aficionado has speculated that Lind's science-dominant assignment was a "reward... for sticking around so long," in contrast to the majority of early STS missions that were centered around routinized satellite deployments.[26]The seven-man crew investigated crystal growth, drop dynamics leading to containerless material processing, atmospheric trace gas spectroscopy, solar and planetary atmospheric simulation, cosmic rays, laboratory animals and human medical monitoring.[1]
With the help of his Alaska postdoctoral group, Lind developed and conducted an experiment to photograph the Earth'saurora. As the experiment used a camera already on the Shuttle, NASA only needed to purchase three rolls of film for $36; Lind described it as "the cheapest experiment that has ever gone into space."[7]After completing 110 orbits of the Earth, theOrbiterChallengerlanded atEdwards Air Force Base, California, on May 6, 1985.[1]
Lind retired from NASA on the twentieth anniversary of his selection in 1986. For nine years thereafter, he served as a professor of physics andastronomyatUtah State University, until his retirement in 1995.[6]

Awards and honors
Lind was a member of theAmerican Geophysical Union, theAmerican Association for the Advancement of Science, andPhi Kappa Phi. Lind was active in theBoy Scouts of Americaand earned the rank ofEagle Scout.[27]He was also awarded theNASA Exceptional Service Medalin 1974, and theNASA Space Flight Medalfollowing hisChallengerflight.[1]

Personal life
Lind married Kathleen Maughan[6]ofLogan, Utah, with whom he had seven children.[1]STS-51-B was two decades after son David's stomach aches from fear of appearing on television like the families of other astronauts, such as neighborsJames IrwinandEdgar Mitchell. Kathleen said before the mission that "For our family, I think we're better off now without the publicity" as space travel became more common.[19]
Throughout his adult life, Lind served as a member of the lay ecclesiastical hierarchy ofthe Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints. He served as amissionaryin the Northeastern United States before graduating from college (1950–52),[6][7]and after STS-51-B spoke inGeneral Conferenceabout his experience.[28]He and his wife Kathleen served as public affairs missionaries in the Europe West Area of the Church, as temple missionaries in theNauvoo Illinois Temple, and, respectively, as a counselor and an assistant matron in the presidency of thePortland Oregon Temple.[29]During his Astronaut Corps service, Lind frequently spoke at LDS Church events throughout the United States.[30][31]Lind's wife Kathleen died on June 12, 2022.[32]
Lind died on August 30, 2022, inLogan, Utah, with many of his children and grandchildren at his bedside.  His funeral was planned for September 10 inSmithfield.[33]
