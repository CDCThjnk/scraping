Colin Michael FoaleCBE(/foʊl/; born 6 January 1957) is aBritish-Americanastrophysicistand a formerNASAastronaut.[1]He is a veteran of six space missions, and is the only NASA astronaut to have flown extended missions aboard bothMirand theInternational Space Station. He was the secondBritonin space and the first to perform a space walk. Until 17 April 2008, he held the record for most time spent in space by a US citizen: 374 days, 11 hours, 19 minutes, and as of 2024[update]he held the cumulative-time-in-space record for a British citizen.[citation needed]

Life and career
Foale was born inLouth, Lincolnshire, to a British father, Colin, and an American mother, Mary. His father was anRAFofficer who retired with the rank ofAir Commodore.[2]Foale was raised inCambridgeand educated atThe King's School, Canterbury. A member of theAir Training Corps, he studied atQueens' College, Cambridgereceiving afirst-class honoursBAdegree in natural sciences in 1978  (later promoted to aCambridge MA), and subsequenltly aPhDin laboratory astrophysics in 1982, where his supervisor wasAlan Cook.[3]When he left university, he "owned two pairs of jeans, a donkey jacket, a bicycle and a pilot's licence; which shows I had my priorities absolutely right".[citation needed]
While a postgraduate student at Cambridge University, Foale participated in the organisation and execution of scientific scuba diving projects. Pursuing a career in the US Space Program, Foale moved to Houston, Texas, to work on Space Shuttle navigation problems forMcDonnell Douglas. In June 1983, Foale joined NASA Johnson Space Center in the payload operations area of the Mission Operations Directorate. In his capacity as payload officer in the Mission Control Center, he was responsible for payload operations on Space Shuttle missions STS-51G, 51-I, 61-B and 61-C.
Born in the United Kingdom, Foale applied and was turned down twice as an astronaut candidate. After theSpace ShuttleChallengerdisasterin January 1986, Foale changed his applicationessayfrom writing about his dreams to focusing on the realities of leadership faced by NASA, and was selected in 1987.[citation needed]
He flew on Space Shuttle missionsSTS-45(1992),[4]STS-56(1993)[5]andSTS-63(1995).[6]In the last mission, he undertook a four-hourEVA. He was then selected for an extended mission aboard the RussianMirspace station.
Launched bySTS-84[7]and returned bySTS-86,[8]Foale spent four months on Mir in 1997 during the Mir 23 and Mir 24 missions. During Mir 23, the station'sSpektrmodule was struck by aProgressresupply vessel.[9]Using knowledge from his physics degree Foale made calculations of how the stars were moving past his fixed-pointthumbreference on a window, and was thus able to advise Russian ground control of how to stop the resulting roll.[citation needed]The two Russian cosmonauts of Mir 23,Vasily TsibliyevandAleksandr Lazutkinwere planned to conduct an intravehicular activity (IVA) to inspect the collision damage from the interior of the space station, but this IVA was actually carried out by Mir EO-24 crew. After theMir EO-24crew exchange, Soyuz TM-26 with all three crew aboard was undocked, repositioned and re-docked. Foale acted as photographer during the operation. Foale and Russian cosmonautAnatoly Solovyevalso conducted a six-hour EVA in RussianOrlan spacesuitsto inspect exterior damage to the Spektr module. Station damage produced significant risk to EVA suit integrity. For his efforts, he was awarded theYuri A. Gagarin Gold Medalby theFédération Aéronautique Internationale.[10]Subsequently, Mir's primary and backup oxygen generation systems failed, but these were successfully repaired by the crew. The station also experienced computer failures and problems orientating the solar arrays at the correct angle to the Sun. All these difficulties combined to produce what, looking back 20 years later, was arguably, the most dangerous long-duration mission for a NASA astronaut. The problems encountered by Foale and his predecessor aboard Mir,Jerry Linenger, resulted in intense political pressure on NASA. The final decision between the termination of NASA crewing of Mir with Foale's departure, or his scheduled replacement byDavid Wolfwas only made by NASA AdministratorDaniel Goldinthe night before the launch ofSTS-86.
In 1999, Foale was a member of Space Shuttle missionSTS-103,[11]during which he conducted an eight-hourspacewalkto replace components of theHubble Space Telescope. In 2003, Foale was named commander ofInternational Space StationExpedition 8with cosmonautAleksandr Kaleri. During their six-month tour of duty on the station, Foale and Kaleri carried out a 4-hour Russian EVA in Orlan-M space suits to install experiments outside the Service Module. The EVA was cut short when significant amounts of water in Kaleri's helmet prevented further work.  Expedition 8 ended on 29 April 2004. For about a year, Foale was Deputy Associate Administrator for Exploration Operations at NASA HQ,Washington D.C.He then supported Soyuz and ISS operations andspacesuitdevelopment for NASA in Houston.
In August 2013, it was announced that Foale was leaving the agency after a 26-year career to work on developing anelectric aircraftto advancegreen aviation technology.[12]Since leaving NASA, Foale has become actively involved in the running of the International Space Schools Education Trust, especially their Mission Discovery and trips toStar City, Russia, giving unique experiences to students around the world. Mission Discovery is held each year at the Guy's Campus at King's College London.

Honours
Foale was awarded anhonorary degreeby theUniversity of Lincolnshire and Humbersidein July 2000[13]and an honoraryDoctor of Sciencedegree by theUniversity of Kentin September 2000.[14]He was invested as a Commander of theOrder of the British Empirein the diplomatic list of theNew Year Honoursin December 2004.[15]
It is possible he has been patron to a pastoral house at the Folkestone Academy in Kent, which is also named after him.[citation needed]A street in Foale's birth town was named Michael Foale Lane.[16][17][18]
Foale andEllen Ochoawere announced as the 2017 class of theUnited States Astronaut Hall of Fame.[19]

Personal life
Married with two children, Foale and his family live inSeabrook, Texas. He is fluent inRussian. Foale is qualified to fly fixed-wing aeroplanes, gliders, as well as helicopters. He has never owned a brand-new car, though he has always wanted one, and his hobbies includewindsurfing,gliding, andcross-country skiing.
Foale was the driver of a car in 1980 inYugoslavia, when a truck accidentally veered across the road and smashed into his car, killing his girlfriend and his brother.[citation needed]His father, Colin Foale, wrote a book in 1999 titledWaystation to the Starsabout the astronaut's experiences on Mir.
In his spare time, he has also worked with the International Space School Educational Trust (ISSET). This involvement is through him taking up the role of the resident astronaut during many of theMission Discoveryprogrammes operated by ISSET, when Foale shares his experiences of being in space with teenagers, while at the same time helping them to learn new skills. He does this throughout the period of the time the programme runs.[20]
