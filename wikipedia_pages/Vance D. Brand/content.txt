Vance DeVoe Brand(born May 9, 1931) is a retired Americannaval officer,aviator,aeronautical engineer,test pilot, andNASA astronaut. He served as command module pilot during the firstU.S.-Soviet joint spaceflightin 1975, and as commander of threeSpace Shuttle missions.
Brand's flight experience includes 9,669 flying hours, which includes 8,089 hours injets, 391 hours inhelicopters, 746 hours in spacecraft, and checkout in more than 30 types of military aircraft.

Early life and education
Brand was born May 9, 1931, inLongmont, Colorado, and is the son of Rudolph William Brand (1903–1984) and Donna Mae Brand (néeDeVoe; 1908–1999).[1]He was active in Troop 64 of theBoy Scouts of Americain Longmont, where he achieved its second highest rank,Life Scout. Brand graduated atLongmont High Schoolin 1949, and at theUniversity of Colorado at Boulderhe received aBachelor of Sciencedegree inbusinessin 1953 and anotherB.S.degree, inaeronautical engineering, in 1960. He was a member of theSigma Nufraternity and of theInternational Order of DeMolay. In 1964 he completed aMaster of Sciencedegree inbusiness administrationatUCLA.

Military service
Brand was a commissioned officer andnaval aviatorwith theUnited States Marine Corpsfrom 1953 to 1957.[1]His military assignments included a 15-month tour in Japan as a jetfighter pilot. Following his release from active duty, Brand continued service inUnited States Marine Corps ReserveandAir National Guardjet fighter squadrons until 1964, reaching the rank ofmajor.

Civilian test pilot
Employed as a civilian by theLockheed Corporationfrom 1960 to 1966, he worked initially as aflight test engineeron theUnited States Navy'sP-3 Orionaircraft. In 1963, Brand graduated from theU.S. Naval Test Pilot School(Class 33) and was assigned toPalmdale, Californiaas an experimental test pilot onCanadianand GermanF-104programs. Prior to selection to the astronaut program, Brand worked at theWest GermanF-104G Flight Test Center atIstres, France as an experimental test pilot and leader of a Lockheed flight test advisory group.

NASA career
One of the19 pilot astronauts selectedby NASA in April 1966,[2]Brand initially was a crew member in thethermal vacuum chambertesting of the prototypecommand module(alongside astronautsJoe Engleand Dr.Joseph Kerwin) and support crewman onApollos8and13. During the Apollo 13 crisis, Brand was CAPCOM during the PC+2 burn.[3]Later he was backup Command Module Pilot forApollo 15, and was likely to be named to the prime crew ofApollo 18before that mission was canceled. Brand was backup commander forSkylabs3and4. When Skylab 3's CSM had problems with its Reaction Control System, Brand was put on standby to commanda rescue missionwith backup PilotDon Lind; however, the crew stood down when it was decided that the problem did not require the rescue mission to be launched. As an astronaut, he held management positions relating to spacecraft development, acquisition, flight safety and mission operations. Brand flew on four space missions;Apollo–Soyuz,STS-5,STS-41-B, andSTS-35. He logged 746 hours in space and commanded three missions. Brand was the last member of his astronaut class to remain active with NASA, and was the only Apollo-era astronaut to pilot the Space Shuttle in the post-Challengerera.
Brand departed the Astronaut Office in 1992 to become Chief of Plans at theNational Aerospace Plane(NASP) Joint Program Office atWright-Patterson Air Force Base. In September 1994, he moved to California to become Assistant Chief of Flight Operations at theDryden Flight Research Center, then Acting Chief Engineer, Deputy Director for Aerospace Projects, and Acting Associate Center Director for Programs. He retired from NASA in January 2008.

Apollo–Soyuz Test Project
Brand was launched on his first space flight on July 15, 1975, as Apollo Command Module Pilot on theApollo–Soyuz Test Projectmission.[1]This flight resulted in the historic meeting in space between American astronauts and Sovietcosmonauts. Other crewmen on this nine-day Earth-orbital mission were Apollo CommanderThomas Stafford, Apollo Docking Module PilotDeke Slayton, Soyuz CommanderAlexei Leonov, and Soyuz Flight EngineerValeri Kubasov. The Soyuz spacecraft was launched atBaikonur Cosmodrome, and the Apollo was launched 7½ hours later at theKennedy Space Center. Two days later, the two spacecraft docked successfully. The linkup tested a new docking system and demonstrated international cooperation in space. There were 44 hours of docked joint activities which included four crew transfers between the Apollo and the Soyuz. Six records for docked and group flight were set on the mission and are recognized by theFédération Aéronautique Internationale. Apollo splashed down in thePacific OceannearHawaii, on July 25, and was recovered byUSSNew Orleans, completing a 217-hour mission. The mission almost ended in disaster when, during the final stages of the mission, the crew was exposed to near fatal amounts ofnitrogen tetroxidegas. The reaction control system had been inadvertently left on during descent, and the poisonous fumes were sucked into the capsule as it drew in outside air. Brand briefly lost consciousness and all three crewmen required hospitalization in Hawaii for a number of weeks after landing.

STS-5
Brand was commander ofSpace ShuttleColumbiaforSTS-5, the first fully operational flight of theSpace Shuttle program, which launched on November 11, 1982.[1]His crew comprised ColonelRobert Overmyer, pilot, and two mission specialists, Dr.Joseph P. Allenand Dr.William B. Lenoir. STS-5, the first mission with a four-man crew, demonstrated the Shuttle as operational by the successful first deployment of two commercial communications satellites from the Shuttle's payload bay. The mission marked the Shuttle's first use of an upper-stage rocket for payloads, the Payload Assist Module (PAM-D). The satellites were deployed for Satellite Business Systems Corporation of McLean, Virginia, and TELESAT ofOttawa, Canada. Two FAI records for mass to altitude were set on the mission. Numerous flight tests were performed to ascertain Shuttle performance. STS-5 was the last flight to carry the Development Flight Instrumentation package to support extensive flight testing. The STS-5 crew concluded the 5-day orbital flight ofColumbiawith the landing approach through a cloud deck to Runway 22 atEdwards Air Force Base, Californiaon November 16, 1982. Mission duration was 122 hours.

STS-41-B
Brand commandedChallengerwith a crew of five on the tenth flight of the Space Shuttle program,STS-41-B.[1]The launch was on February 3, 1984.[4]His crew included CommanderRobert L. Gibson, pilot, and 3Mission Specialists, CaptainBruce McCandless II, Dr.Ronald McNair, and Lt. Col.Robert L. Stewart. The flight accomplished the deployment of two Hughes HS-376 communications satellites which failed to reach desiredgeosynchronousorbits due to upper-stage rocket failures. This mission marked the first flight checkout of theManned Maneuvering Unitand theManipulator Foot Restraintwith McCandless and Stewart performing two untethered extravehicular activities. Shuttle rendezvous sensors and computer programs were flight-tested for the first time. The 8-day flight ofChallengerended with the first landing on the runway at the Kennedy Space Center on February 11, 1984.
Brand was training initially forSTS-51-HonAtlantisin November 1985. That mission was canceled and re-manifested asSTS-61-K, aSpacelabmission which would have launched onColumbiain October 1986. That mission was canceled by theChallengerdisaster.

STS-35
Brand again commandedColumbiaon the 38th flight of the shuttle, this time with a crew of seven, onSTS-35.[1]The night launch on December 2, 1990, started a nine-day mission devoted to round-the-clock astronomical observations.[5]Crewmen included the pilot, Col.Guy Gardner; three mission specialists,John M. Lounge, Dr.Robert A. Parkerand Dr.Jeffrey A. Hoffman; and twopayload specialists, Dr.Samuel T. Durranceand Dr.Ronald A. Parise. The 13-ton payload consisted of the three ASTRO-1 ultraviolet (UV) telescopes and the Broadband X-ray Telescope. More than 200 Orbiter maneuvers were required to point the telescopes. This Shuttle flight, one of the first dedicated to astronomy, provided a rich return of science data with emphasis on observations of very active celestial objects. A night landing was made on December 10, to Runway 22 at Edwards Air Force Base. Mission duration was 215 hours.

Brand is married to the former Beverly Ann Whitnel and has two daughters and four sons: Susan Nancy (born April 30, 1954), Stephanie Brand Lowery (born August 6, 1955), Patrick Richard (born March 22, 1958), Kevin Stephen (born December 1, 1963), Erik Ryan (May 11, 1981), and Dane Vance (born October 1, 1985). He currently resides with his wife inTehachapi, California.[13][14]

Philanthropy
In 2019, Brand donated 40 acres of land to the Rocky Mountain Conservancy, which is the nonprofit arm ofRocky Mountain National Park, hoping to expand the national park that he has visited throughout his life. He had purchased the land in 1967. The 40 acres of rugged terrain, located near Estes Cone and roughly 4 miles from Longs Peak, borders Rocky Mountain National Park on two sides. TheUnited States Congresswill need to approve the boundary change for this acreage to be officially incorporated into the national park.[15][16]
