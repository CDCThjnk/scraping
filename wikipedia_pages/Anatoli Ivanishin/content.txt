On 29 May 2003, Ivanishin was enlisted as a cosmonaut candidate to go through space training. On 16 June 2003, he began training and passed the state examinations with a rating of "excellent" on 28 June 2005. On 5 July 2005, Ivanishin was awarded the test cosmonaut qualification.
On October 15, 2021, Roscosmos announced that Ivanishin was retiring from the Cosmonaut training centre to devote most of his time to "scientific activities"[3]

Expedition 29/30
Ivanishin served as theSoyuz TMA-20backup commander, backing up Russian cosmonautDimitri Kondratyevfor ISSExpedition 26/27, directly holding the position of Expedition 27 backup Commander. TMA-20 launched on 15 December 2010, following which Ivanishin was assigned as Flight Engineer for ISSExpedition 29/30.
On 14 November 2011, Ivanishin launched on his first flight into space as flight engineer on boardSoyuz TMA-22alongside Roscosmos cosmonautAnton Shkaplerovand NASA astronautDaniel Burbank, the three successfully arrived at the space station on 16 November following a two-day free flight to the ISS.[4]They officially joined Roscosmos cosmonautSergey Volkov, JAXA astronautSatoshi Furukawaand NASA astronautMike Fossumas members of the Expedition 29 crew. The Expedition ended only days later with the departure ofSoyuz TMA-02Mon 21 November 2011, carrying Volkov, Furukawa and Fossum back to Earth,[5]following which Burbank took command of the station for Expedition 30.
The three were soon joined by Roscosmos cosmonautOleg Kononenko, DutchESAastronautAndré Kuipersand NASA astronautDonald Pettit, who launched aboardSoyuz TMA-03Mon 21 December 2011.[6]On 16 February 2012, Ivanishin supported aspacewalkby his fellow cosmonauts, Shkaplerov and Kononenko, who performed a six-hour, 15-minute EVA from thePirsairlock module on the Russian segment of the ISS. The two set up several experiments on the outside of the station and moved aStrelacrane from Pirs to thePoiskmodule while Burbank and Ivanishin remained inside Soyuz TMA-22 in case of an emergency.[7]
Due to a delay with the launch of theExpedition 31/32crew on boardSoyuz TMA-04M, the landing of Soyuz TMA-22 was delayed from March to late April 2012.[8]Ivanishin, along with Shkaplerov and Burbank, landed safely inKazakhstanon 27 April, wrapping up his first spaceflight after 165 days in orbit.[9]

Expedition 48/49
For his second flight, Ivanishin was assigned to the crew of ISSExpedition 48/49, serving as a flight engineer on Expedition 48 and Commander on Expedition 49. Originally this flight was to have launched onSoyuz TMA-20M, the final flight of theSoyuz TMA-M series of spacecraft, although delays with the launch of the firstSoyuz MSseries spacecraft, originally scheduled to launch the Expedition 47/48 crew, was pushed back to Expedition 48/49, so Ivanishin's crew instead were assigned to launch aboardSoyuz MS-01.[10]
Ivanishin, alongsideJAXAastronautTakuya OnishiandNASAastronautKathleen Rubinslaunched into space on board Soyuz MS-01 on 7 July 2016, following a delay from 24 June due to issues with the spacecraft software. The trio spent two days in orbit testing various new systems on the Soyuz MS spacecraft, before rendezvous and docking with the ISS on 9 July, officially becoming members of the Expedition 48 crew alongside NASA astronautJeff Williamsand Russian cosmonautsAleksey OvchininandOleg Skripochka.[11]
Expedition 48 officially ended on 6 September 2016 with the departure of Soyuz TMA-20M, following which Ivanishin took Command of the station for Expedition 49. They were supposed to be joined by the three crew members onSoyuz MS-02on 25 September, although continuing issues with the introduction of the Soyuz MS spacecraft forced the launch of MS-02 to be delayed due to technical reasons.[12]Soyuz MS-02 was successfully launched on 19 October 2016, carrying Roscosmos cosmonautsSergey RyzhikovandAndrei Borisenkoas well as NASA astronautShane Kimbroughto the station. They arrived on 21 October and joined Ivanishin and his crew.[13]
Following a very short period of six crew operations with the crew of Soyuz MS-02, Ivanishin handed over command of the station to Kimbrough, following which he returned to Earth with his two crewmates on 29 October 2016 following 115 days in space, bringing up Ivanishin's total time in orbit to 280 days.[14]

Expedition 62/63
Ivanishin was assigned to back up Russian Soyuz CommanderNikolai Tikhonovfor the mission ofSoyuz MS-16, scheduled for launch in April 2020. However, in February 2020 Tikhonov and Russian Flight EngineerAndrei Babkinwere removed from the flight due to a temporary health condition with Tikhonov. Subsequently, Ivanishin andIvan Vagner(Babkin's backup) were moved forward onto the prime crew.
Ivanishin launched aboard Soyuz MS-16, along with Vagner and NASA astronautChristopher Cassidy, on 9 April 2020. The trio successfully arrived in orbit and docked with the ISS six hours later, officially joining the Expedition 62 crew alongside Roscosmos cosmonautOleg Skripochkaand NASA astronautsJessica MeirandAndrew R. Morgan. Following just eight days of six-person operations, Morgan, Meir and Skripochka departed the space station aboardSoyuz MS-15, following which Ivanishin and his two crewmates transferred over to Expedition 63, with Cassidy taking command of the station.[15]
The Expedition 63 crew welcomed theCrew Dragon Demo-2mission for a stay on board the station on 31 May 2020.[16]This flight marked the first crewed test flight of theSpaceXCrew Dragonspacecraft and the first crewed orbital spacecraft to launch from US soil sinceSTS-135, the final flight of theSpace Shuttle program, in 2011.[17]The mission was crewed by NASA astronautsDoug HurleyandRobert Behnken, who stayed onboard the ISS for two months.[18]
