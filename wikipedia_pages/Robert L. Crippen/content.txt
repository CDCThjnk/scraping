Robert Laurel Crippen(born September 11, 1937) is an American retirednaval officerandaviator,test pilot,aerospace engineer, andastronaut. He traveled into space four times: as pilot ofSTS-1in April 1981, the firstSpace Shuttlemission; and as commander ofSTS-7in June 1983,STS-41-Cin April 1984, andSTS-41-Gin October 1984. He was also a part of theManned Orbiting Laboratory(MOL),Skylab Medical Experiment Altitude Test(SMEAT),ASTPsupport crew member, and theApproach and Landing Tests(ALT) for theSpace Shuttle.
In 1986, Crippen participated in the recovery operations for the remains of crew members after theSpace ShuttleChallengerdisaster. He was also on the commission responsible for determining the cause of the accident.
After retiring as an astronaut, Crippen worked his way through management atNASA, namely as Director, Space Shuttle, atNASA Headquarters, then Director of theKennedy Space Center. He also went toLockheed MartinandThiokolPropulsion before retiring to private life inFlorida.
Crippen has received several awards and honors, including theCongressional Space Medal of Honorin 2006, and having an elementary school named after him inPorter, Texas. He is also afellowof several organizations, including theAmerican Institute of Aeronautics and Astronautics(AIAA) and theSociety of Experimental Test Pilots(SETP).

Early life and education
Robert Crippen was born inBeaumont, Texas, on September 11, 1937.[1]After graduating fromNew Caney High SchoolinNew Caney, Texasin 1955, Crippen went to theUniversity of Texas at Austinto major inAerospace Engineering. In 1960, he graduated with hisBachelor of Sciencedegree.[1][2][3]He was selected as a member of the Texas Alpha chapter ofTau Beta PiandSigma Gamma Tau.[4]
Crippen became interested in flying and computers at a very early age. He attended the first computer programming class held at the University of Texas. Throughout his career in the military and at NASA, he worked on computer programming, including programs such as the Manned Orbiting Laboratory, Skylab and the Space Shuttle.[5]

Military career
Crippen was commissioned through theUnited States Navy'sAviation Officer Candidate School(AOCS) Program atNaval Air Station Pensacola,Florida.[1]He also spent time at theNaval Air Station Whiting Fieldin Florida and theNaval Air Station Chase FieldinBeeville, Texas. That is where he earned his wings. As aNaval Aviatorfrom the summer of 1962 to the end of 1964, he made two deployments aboard theUSSIndependence, flying theA-4 Skyhawkin Attack Squadron 72 (VA-72). He later went toEdwards Air Force BaseinCaliforniato attend theU.S. Air ForceAerospace Research Pilot School. After graduation, Crippen worked as an instructor at Edwards Air Force Base until October 1966 when he was picked for theU.S. Air Force'sManned Orbiting Laboratory(MOL) program.[1]He has spent more than 6,500 hours in the air as either a pilot or an astronaut.[2]

Manned Orbiting Laboratory
TheManned Orbiting Laboratory(MOL) program was a follow-on to theX-20 Dyna-Soarprogram. A joint program between the United States Air Force and theNational Reconnaissance Office(NRO), the MOL program would send humans into space.[6]
Publicly, the MOL program was designed to determine the usefulness of man in space. Crews would be in orbit for about a month and they would be able to freely move about the laboratory.[7]The secret and primary mission was to perform reconnaissance missions onSoviet UnionandChina. The pilots were not told of this true mission, though they were later informed.[8]
When Crippen was selected for astronaut training in October 1966, he had to choose between the military and NASA, deciding to stay in the military to work on the MOL program. He felt that he would get lost at NASA due to the number of astronauts already in programs at the agency. There was an uncrewed flight on November 3, 1966. There were no crewed flights.[5]
The MOL program was canceled in June 1969,[6]after which Crippen transferred to NASA to continue his career.[5]The cancellation was due to differing priorities within the military and space programs, with the government deciding to de-emphasize military involvement in the space program. However, developments like the space suit, waste management, and the high resolution camera were later used in various space programs going forward.[9]

NASA career
We were flying on a winged vehicle that would do reentry different than we had ever done before. So all of those were firsts. Test pilots truly love firsts.
After the MOL program was canceled, Crippen became part ofNASA Astronaut Group 7in September 1969.[1]He served as support for theSkylab 2,Skylab 3, andSkylab 4, as well as for the Apollo-Soyuz Test Project.[1]

Skylab Medical Experiment Altitude Test (SMEAT)
The Skylab Medical Experiment Altitude Test (SMEAT) was a 56-day mission (July 26 through September 19, 1972), where astronauts Crippen,Karol J. BobkoandWilliam E. Thorntonwere housed in a vacuum chamber to conduct medical experiments. The goal was to ensure that crews in space could handle minor medical emergencies, including dentistry.[5]SMEAT also was able to discover and fix the design flaws in the urine handling system for Skylab.[11]Crippen and the team worked to enlarge the original collection system design, which was too small, the collection system of which had burst at one point.[5]

Apollo-Soyuz Test Project
The Apollo-Soyuz Test Project (ASTP) was a joint effort between theUnited Statesand the Soviet Union, designed to test rendezvous and docking capabilities if there were ever an emergency in space.[12]Crippen was thecapsule communicator(CAPCOM) for the Apollo-Soyuz Test Project (as well as Skylab), during which time he developed a close association with Mission Operations and Flight Control.[5]On July 15, 1975, the United States launched aSaturn IBlaunch vehicle in an Apollo configuration into space. Two days later, it docked with aSoyuzspacecraft.[12]

Approach and Landing Tests (ALT)
The Approach and Landing tests for the Space Shuttle were critical to the overall program, in which a crew tested the maneuverability and landing capabilities of the spacecraft. Launched from a 747 aircraft, the prototypeSpace Shuttle Enterprisewas first tested on August 12, 1977. AstronautsFred W. Haise Jr.andC. Gordon Fullertonpiloted theEnterprisefrom about 7,300 m (24,000 ft) to the ground and landed at Edwards Air Force Base. A second crew of astronautsJoe H. EngleandRichard H. Trulyalternated with Haise and Fullerton to test the Enterprise's capabilities.[13]Crippen was first assigned to family support with the testing, then progressed to being a chase pilot in a T-38.[5]The ALT program lasted about a year, testing all aspects of approach and touchdown from aerodynamics to maneuverability, gliding and landing characteristics.[14]

STS-1
Crippen was the pilot of theSpace ShuttleColumbiaon STS-1, the first test flight of the Space Shuttle in orbit.[15]His job involved working with the Shuttle computers, electrical systems, and auxiliary power units. He was also responsible for operating the payload bay doors.[5]STS-1 had several firsts: a crewed vehicle to be flown into Earth orbit without any prior non-crewed orbital testing; a crewed, winged vehicle to launch with solid rocket boosters;[15]a reentry vehicle to land on a conventional runway. It launched April 12, 1981, and landed April 14, 1981.[16]

STS-7
Crippen served as the commander of STS-7, the second launch of theSpace ShuttleChallenger, and headed a crew of five people. During flight, the team deployed theCanadianAnik-C2satellite, as well as thePalapa-B1satellite fromIndonesia. They also used the Canadian Remote Manipulator System (Canadarm) to deploy and retrieve theShuttle Pallet Satellite(SPAS-01). They conducted formation flying with an untethered satellite (SPAS-02), operated a joint U.S.-German materials experiment (OSTA-2) and activated sevenGetaway Special(GAS) experiments. Finally, they worked with the Continuous Flow Electrophoresis System (CFES) and the Monodisperse Latex Reactor (MLR). It launched June 18, 1983, and landed on June 24, 1983.

STS-41-C
Crippen was the commander ofSpace ShuttleChallengeron STS-41-C, a seven-day mission during which the crew deployed theLong Duration Exposure Facility(LDEF). The crew also retrieved, repaired and redeployedSolar Maximum Mission(SMM) satellite using the Canadarm. The flight also tested theManned Maneuvering Units(MMU) through twoextravehicular activities(EVAs). The team also operated the Cinema 360 andIMAX Camera Systems. Finally, the crew ran a student experiment onhoney bees. It launched April 6, 1984, and landed April 13, 1984.

STS-41-G
On his final spaceflight, Crippen served as the commander of STS-41-G. During the eight-day flight, the Space ShuttleChallengercrew deployed theEarth Radiation Budget Satellite(ERBS). They also performed scientific observations of theEarthwith aLarge Format Camera, and demonstrated potential satellite refueling with the Orbital Refueling System (ORS). Finally, the Office of Space and Terrestrial Applications-3 (OSTA-3) also had experiments for the crew to perform. It launched October 5, 1984, and landed October 13, 1984, at Kennedy Space Center, Florida.[17]

Post-spaceflight career
After STS-41-G, Crippen became deputy director of flight crew operations (1984–1986)[18]and was also named commander of theSTS-62-Amission which would have launched from the newSLC-6facility atVandenberg Air Force Base, California. That mission was canceled after theSpace ShuttleChallengerdisasterin 1986, andSLC-6was mothballed in 1989.[19]
Crippen was personally involved in the recovery efforts of theChallengerdisaster, brooking no interference in recovering all seven bodies of the Challenger crew for their families.[20]Crippen was also a part of theSTS-51-L Interim Mishap Review Boardto examine the cause of theChallengeraccident. The Board became a sub-team for theRogers Commission Report, the team put together byPresident Ronald Reaganto investigate the accident.
Crippen was stationed atKennedy Space Center(KSC) from July 1987 to December 1989 where he was Deputy Director of Shuttle Operations under Arnie Aldrich, Director of Space Shuttle. He was accountable for Shuttle missions and the return of the craft to KSC after landings at Edwards.
From January 1990 to January 1992, Crippen served as Director of the Space Shuttle program atNASA Headquarters. As such, he was responsible for the all aspects of the Shuttle program, including scheduling, budget and overall program management. Afterwards, he moved to KSC to become center director. This lasted from January 1992 through January 1995.[18]

Post-NASA career
After leaving NASA, from April 1995 through November 1996, Crippen was theVice PresidentofLockheed MartinInformation Systems. His main focus was simulation work supporting the military.[5]
Crippen becamePresidentofThiokolPropulsion from December 1996 through April 2001. They were responsible for producing theSpace Shuttle Reusable Solid Rocket Motors.[21]Crippen enjoyed continuing his connection with the Space Shuttle program. In particular, he appreciated his role in working to improve the design of the solid rocket boosters to prevent anotherChallengerdisaster.[5]

Organizations
Crippen is afellowin the American Institute of Aeronautics and Astronautics (AIAA), the Society of Experimental Test Pilots (SETP), and theAmerican Astronautical Society(AAS).[2]He served as President of the American Institute of Aeronautics and Astronautics in 1999.[22]He was selected to be a member of Naval Aviators Golden Eagles in 2009. He was elected to theNational Academy of Engineeringin 2012 for leadership in human space flight and development of solid fueled rockets.[23]

Awards and honors
Crippen has earned several awards throughout his career, including the SETPIven C. Kincheloe Award(1981)[24]and theNASA Exceptional Service Medal(1972).
