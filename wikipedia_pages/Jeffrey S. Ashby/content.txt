As atest pilotin theU.S. Navy, Ashby helped develop theF/A-18aircraft and flew the aircraft incombat missionsas part ofOperation Desert StormandOperation Southern Watchduring and after theGulf Warand as part ofOperation Continue HopeinSomalia. He was the Navy Attack Aviator of the Year in 1991. Ashby commanded a Fighter Squadron stationed aboard theaircraft carrierUSSAbraham Lincoln; in 1994, his squadron was designated the top F/A-18 squadron in the Navy.[1]
During Desert Storm while based on theUSSMidway (CV-41), Ashby became the first F/A-18 pilot to deploy theWalleye TV guided bombin combat. During that mission, his F/A-18A Hornet fromVFA-195deployed a Walleye II to attack a T-shaped building atUmm Qasr Naval Base. According to him, it was also the first time that his Air Wing (Carrier Air Wing 5) had used the Walleye in combat.[2]
Later in the war, on February 13, 1991,[3]Ashby and his wingman found and destroyed a camouflaged IraqiSuper Frelon helicopterwhich had been armed with Exocet cruise missiles that could've attacked theMidway. Ashby released a Walleye I into the helicopter and brought back TV footage of the attack back toMidway. This allowed the Persian Gulf carriers to move closer to Kuwait.[1][2]After the war, the aircraft he flew on the Super Frelon strike (NF-104), was displayed atNAF Atsugiin Japan in May 1991.[2]
