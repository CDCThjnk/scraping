Kononenko conducted his first spacewalk on 10 July 2008 when he ventured into space from thePirsdocking compartmentairlock of the ISS.[8]He and cosmonautSergey Volkovinspected their Soyuz TMA-12 spacecraft and retrieved a pyro bolt from it. This spacewalk lasted 6 hours and 18 minutes.[9]
On 15 July 2008, Kononenko again went outside fromPirsto conduct his second spacewalk.[10]Kononenko and Volkov installed one experiment and retrieved another. They also continued to outfit the station's exterior, including the installation of a docking target on theZvezdaservice module. The spacewalk was in RussianOrlan suitsand Kononenko wore an Orlan suit with blue stripes. The spacewalk lasted 5 hours and 54 minutes.[citation needed]
Kononenko returned to Earth with Expedition 17 commanderSergei Volkovandspaceflight participantRichard Garriott(who launched aboardSoyuz TMA-13to the ISS on 12 October 2008 with theExpedition 18crew).[11][12]They landed at 11:37 p.mEDT55 miles north ofArkalyk,Kazakhstan.

They installed shields on the Zvezda Service Module to protect it from micrometeoroid orbital debris and moved the Strela 1 crane from the Pirs docking compartment to the Poisk Mini Research Module (MRM-2). The two cosmonauts also installed struts on a ladder used by spacewalkers on the Pirs Docking Compartment. As another get-ahead task, they also installed an experiment called Vynoslivost on the Poisk Mini Research Module. As part of the Vynoslivost or "Endurance" experiment, two trays of metal samples would be left exposed on the surface of the Poisk Module.[18]The crew returned to Earth on 1 July 2012.[19]
