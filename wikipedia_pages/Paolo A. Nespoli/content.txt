He participated as a mission specialist and  remained in space for 15 days, 2 hours and 23 minutes. During STS-120, he participated in the Esperia mission for theEuropean Space Agency.[6]

Expedition 26/27 'MagISStra'
Paolo Nespoli served as first flight engineer forExpedition 26/27, Europe's third six-month mission to theInternational Space Station(ISS).[7]
On 15 December 2010 Nespoli flew aboard theSoyuz TMA-20spacecraft fromBaikonur CosmodromeinKazakhstanto the International Space Station with the Russian cosmonautDmitri Kondratyevand NASA's astronautCatherine Coleman. The three members of the crew returned to Earth on 24 May 2011. This mission, dubbed ‘MagISStra’, is Paolo Nespoli's second flight in space.
From 15 December 2010 to 24 May 2011, Paolo Nespoli's duties[8]aboard the ISS included participating in the docking operations to receive Europe's secondAutomated Transfer Vehicle(ATV-2)Johannes Kepler, a visiting spacecraft that will deliver essential cargo to the Station.
In early January, Nespoli filmed the majority of the footage for the 2011 documentary filmFirst Orbit, and as a result is credited as itsdirector of photography.
Nespoli took part in the arrival of the second Japanese HII Transfer Vehicle (HTV-2), an uncrewed spacecraft used to resupply the ISS. He was the prime operator for berthing the HTV-2 to the ISS after the free-flying vehicle was captured by NASA astronaut Catherine Coleman.

During Nespoli's stint with Expedition 27, his mother, Maria, died on 4 May 2011. The crew observed 1 minute of silence the following day around the time of her funeral.[9]
Paolo Nespoli carried out an intensive programme of experiments in the Station, ranging from radiation monitoring to measurements that could improveoil recoveryin petroleum reservoirs. The mission scientific programme covered different fields on human research, fluid physics, radiation, biology and technology demonstrations.
Nespoli contributed to the scientific exploitation of Europe'sColumbuslaboratory. As an astronaut, he carried out several experiments for ESA, NASA and also the Japanese and Canadian space agencies. During the mission, Paolo participated in some educational activities: the educational programme"Mission X: Train Like an Astronaut"which gave children the chance to follow an international initiative built around health, well-being and nutrition. He also participated in a greenhouse activity in space. Nespoli used ESA's novel 3D camera to show images of the ISS.
As Paolo left the ISS on 23 May 2011 in theSoyuz TMA-20he was able to take the first pictures of a Space Shuttle docked with the ISS from the perspective of a RussianSoyuz spacecraft.[10]

Expedition 52/53 and the VITA mission
Nespoli was  part of Expedition 52/53, which started in 2017. He launched onSoyuz MS-05on 28 July 2017 15:41 UTC.[11]Nespoli's mission to the ISS was calledVITA. Vita is an acronym for Vitality, Innovation, Technology and Ability. In addition, in Italian it means life, reflecting the scientific experiments and the technologies needed for life in space. Additional activities included outreach like Mission-X: Train Like an Astronaut, the European Astro Pi Challenge (where European students run their own code on Raspberry Pi mini computers installed on the ISS).[12]
The mission's logo was developed and created jointly byESA,Italian Space Agency, and Nespoli.
The overall circle represent the planet Earth, with the main objectives linked by a symbol which is a reformulation of theinfinitysymbol, called "Third paradise" and designed by Michelangelo Pistoletto. Connected inside are aDNAstrand for the scientific experiments, a book for education, outreach and culture, and Earth as a symbol of humanity. The colors represent the Italian flag.[13]
During the VITA Mission Nespoli completed more than 60 experiments.[14]He also recorded the first content created in space specifically for use onWikipedia.[1]During his first month in orbit Nespoli acted as cinematographer for National Geographic Channel'sOne Strange Rock, filming the sequences with astronautPeggy Whitsonwhich appear in episode 10 of the series.[15]
