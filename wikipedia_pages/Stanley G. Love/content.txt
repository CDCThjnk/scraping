Stanley Glen Love(born June 8, 1965) is an American scientist and aNASAastronautfromOregon.[1]

Early life
Love was born on June 8, 1965, to Glen A. Love and Rhoda M. Love inSan Diego, California. However, Love has stated he considersEugene, Oregon,[2][3]to be his hometown. Love graduated fromWinston Churchill High Schoolin Eugene, Oregon, in 1983. He received aBachelor of Sciencedegree inphysicsfromHarvey Mudd CollegeinClaremont, California(1987), andM.S.(1989) andPh.D.degrees (1993) from theUniversity of WashingtoninAstronomy.[1][4]

Academic career
Love worked at theUniversity of Oregonas acomputer programminginstructor during the summer of 1984 and as an assistant in physics andchemistrylaboratories from 1985 to 1987. As a graduate teaching assistant at theUniversity of WashingtoninSeattlebeginning in 1987, he taught undergraduate classes in general and planetaryastronomy. He worked as a graduate research assistant at the University of Washington from 1989 to 1993. He moved to theUniversity of Hawaiiin 1994 for postdoctoral research. In 1995, he was awarded a postdoctoral prize from theCalifornia Institute of Technology. In 1997, he went to work as a staff engineer at theJet Propulsion Laboratory.[1]

NASA career
Love joinedNASAin June 1998 and started training in August of that year. Love completed both basic astronaut candidate training and advanced training. He served as aCAPCOM(spacecraft communicator) inMission Controlfor StationExpeditions 1through7and forSpace ShuttlemissionsSTS-104,STS-108,STS-112[1]andSTS-132. In 2008, Love participated in his first spaceflight with the crew ofSTS-122aboardSpace ShuttleAtlantisand logged over 306 hours in space, including twoEVAs.  The mission began on February 7, 2008, and ended on February 20, 2008.[1]
On September 19, 2011,NASAannounced that Love would participate in theNEEMO 15undersea exploration mission in October 2011 from theDeepWorker 2000submersible.  The DeepWorker is a smallsubmarineused as an underwater stand-in for theSpace Exploration Vehicle, which might someday be used to explore the surface of anasteroid.[5]However, because NEEMO 15 ended early due to the approach ofHurricane Rina, Love was not able to pilot the DeepWorker during the mission.[6]Love was able to pilot the DeepWorker during theNEEMO 16mission in June 2012, during which he experienced an interesting incident when his submersible became pinned against the bottom of the support vesselLiberty Star.[7][8]
As of May 2019, Love is a management astronaut which means he is no longer eligible for flight assignment. Love works as the Deputy Chief of the Astronaut Office's Rapid Prototying Laboratory, developing cockpit displays and controls for Orion and forthcoming spacecraft.[1]

Spaceflight
STS-122Atlantis(February 7–20, 2008) was the 24th shuttle mission to visit theInternational Space Station. The primary objective of the flight was to carry theEuropean Space Agency’sColumbus Laboratorymodule to the Space Station and install it there permanently. Love performed twospacewalksto help prepare the Columbus Laboratory for installation, to add two science payloads to the outside of Columbus, and to carry a failed Station gyroscope to the Shuttle for return to Earth. STS-122 was also a crew replacement mission, deliveringExpedition 16Flight EngineerLéopold Eyharts, and returning home with Expedition 16 Flight EngineerDaniel Tani. The STS-122 mission was accomplished in 12 days, 18 hours, 21 minutes, and 40 seconds, and traveled 5,296,832 statute miles in 203 Earth orbits.

Memberships
Love's memberships include theAmerican Astronomical Society; Division for Planetary Science; theAmerican Geophysical Union; theAmerican Institute of Aeronautics and Astronautics(Associate Fellow); theMeteoritical Society; and the Harvey Mudd College Alumni Association.[1][4]

Personal life
Love is married and has two children. He has a wide range of hobbies which includemartial arts,hiking,science fiction,music, andanime. His parents are currently residing inOregon.[1][4]
