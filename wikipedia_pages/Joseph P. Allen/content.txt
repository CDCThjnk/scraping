Joseph Percival"Joe"Allen IV(born June 27, 1937) is an American formerNASAastronaut. He logged more than 3,000 hours flying time injet aircraft.

Early life and education
Allen was born inCrawfordsville, Indiana, in June 1937. His parents, Mr. and Mrs. Joseph P. Allen III, had resided inFrankfort, Indiana. He attended Mills School, and is a graduate ofCrawfordsville High Schoolin Indiana, Class of 1955; received aBachelor of Artsdegree inMathematicsandPhysicsfromDePauw Universityin 1959, where he was a member of Delta chapter ofBeta Theta Pi,[1]and aMaster of Scienceand aDoctor of Philosophydegrees in Physics fromYale Universityin 1961 and 1965,[2]respectively. At Yale, Allen worked with future physicistRichard F. Casten.[3]
Allen was a research associate in the Nuclear Physics Laboratory at theUniversity of Washingtonprior to his selection as an astronaut. He was a staff physicist at the Nuclear Structure Laboratory at Yale University in 1965 and 1966, and during the period 1963 to 1967, served as a guest researcher atBrookhaven National Laboratory.

NASA experience
Allen was selected as a scientist-astronaut by NASA in August 1967 as a member of the second group ofscientist-astronauts.[4]He completed flight training atVance Air Force Base,Oklahoma. He served as mission scientist while a member of the astronaut support crew forApollo 15and served as a staff consultant on science and technology to the President's Council on International Economic Policy.
From August 1975 to 1978, Allen served as NASA Assistant Administrator for Legislative Affairs inWashington, D.C.Returning to theJohnson Space Centerin 1978, as a senior scientist astronaut, Allen was assigned to the Operations Mission Development Group. He served as a support crew member for the first orbital flight test of theSpace Shuttle(Columbia) in April 1981 and was theCAPCOMduring the reentry phase for this mission. In addition, in 1980 and 1981, he worked as the technical assistant to the director of flight operations.[5]

Space experience
Allen served as mission specialist onSTS-5, the first fully operational flight of theSpace Shuttle program, which launched fromKennedy Space Center,Florida, on November 11, 1982. He was accompanied byVance D. Brand(spacecraft commander), Col.Robert F. Overmyer(pilot), and Dr.William B. Lenoir(mission specialist). STS-5, the first mission with four crewmembers, clearly demonstrated theSpace Shuttleas fully operational by the successful first deployment of two commercial communicationssatellitesfrom the Orbiter's payload bay. The mission marked the first use of thePayload Assist Module(PAM-D), and its new ejection system. Numerous flight tests were performed throughout the mission to document Shuttle performance during launch, boost, orbit, atmospheric entry and landing phases. STS-5 was the last flight to carry theDevelopment Flight Instrumentation(DFI) package to support flight testing. A Getaway Special, three Student Involvement Projects, and medical experiments were included on the mission. A plannedspacewalkby Allen and Lenoir, the first of the Space Shuttle program, was postponed by one day after Lenoir became ill, and then had to be canceled when the twospacesuitsthat were to be used developed problems.[6]The STS-5 crew successfully concluded the 5-day orbital flight ofSpace ShuttleColumbiawith the first entry and landing through a cloud deck to a hard-surface runway and demonstrated maximum braking. STS-5 completed 81 orbits of the Earth in 122 hours before landing on a concrete runway atEdwards Air Force Base,California, on November 16, 1982.
Allen was a mission specialist onSTS 51-A, which launched from Kennedy Space Center, Florida, on November 8, 1984. He was accompanied by CaptainFrederick (Rick) Hauck(spacecraft commander), CaptainDavid M. Walker(pilot), and fellow mission specialists, Dr.Anna Lee Fisherand CommanderDale Gardner. This was the second flight of the OrbiterDiscovery.  During the mission the crew deployed two satellites, Canada's Anik D-2 (Telesat H) and Hughes' LEASAT-1 (Syncom IV-1), and operated the3M Company's Diffusive Mixing of Organic Solutions experiment. In the first space salvage attempt in history, Allen and Gardner performed spacewalks and successfully retrieved for return to Earth thePalapa B-2andWestarVI communications satellites. STS 51-A completed 127 orbits of the Earth in 192 hours before landing at Kennedy Space Center, Florida, on November 16, 1984. With the completion of this flight Allen logged a total of 314 hours in space.

Post-NASA experience
Allen served as chief executive officer ofSpace Industries International, Washington, D.C., and later was chairman ofVeridian, until he retired in 2004.General Dynamicsannounced its acquisition of Veridian on June 9, 2003.
