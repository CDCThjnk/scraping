Russell Louis"Rusty"Schweickart(alsoSchweikart; born October 25, 1935) is an Americanaeronautical engineer, and a formerNASAastronaut,research scientist,U.S. Air Forcefighter pilot, as well as a formerbusiness executiveandgovernment executive.
Schweickart was selected in 1963 forNASA's third astronaut group.  He was theLunar ModulePilot on the 1969Apollo 9mission, the first crewed flight test of the lunar module, on which he performed the first in-space test of theportable life support systemused by the Apollo astronauts who walked on theMoon. As backup commander of thefirst crewed Skylab missionin 1973, he was responsible for developing the hardware and procedures used by the first crew to perform critical in-flight repairs of theSkylab station. After Skylab, he served for a time as Director of User Affairs in NASA's Office of Applications.
Schweickart left NASA in 1977 to serve for two years asCalifornia GovernorJerry Brown's assistant for science and technology, then was appointed by Brown toCalifornia's Energy Commissionfor five and a half years, serving aschairmanfor three.[2]
In 1984–85, Schweickart co-founded theAssociation of Space Explorersand later in 2002 co-founded theB612 Foundation, a non-profit organization dedicated to defending Earth fromasteroid impacts, along with fellow former astronautEd Luand two planetary scientists. He served for a period as its chair before becoming its chairemeritus.

Early life and education
Rusty Schweickart was born October 25, 1935, inNeptune Township, New Jersey, and grew up on a "hardscrabble" farm of 45 acres (18 ha) producing hay and vegetables plus raising poultry and cows. As a youth his ambition was to be apilotand acowboy.[3]After graduating fromManasquan High Schoolin 1952, he earned aBachelor of Sciencedegree inaeronautical engineeringon scholarship (1956) and aMaster of Sciencedegree inaeronauticsandastronautics(1963) from theMassachusetts Institute of Technology.[2][4]
He was active in theBoy Scouts of America. He earned the rank ofFirst Class.[5]His hobbies includegolf,bicycling, andhiking. He was married twice and has seven children.[2]
His family's stated annual income when he received hisMassachusetts Institute of Technologyscholarship after graduating high school was listed as $1800 (equivalent to $21,314 in 2024).[3]

Military and NASA career
Schweickart served in theU.S. Air ForceandMassachusetts Air National Guard(101st Tactical Fighter Squadron) from 1956 to 1963, with over 4,000 hours of flight time, including 3,500 hours in high performancejet aircraft.[2]
Prior to joining NASA, Schweickart was aresearch scientistat the Experimental Astronomy Laboratory at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, and his work there involved research upperatmospheric physics, star tracking and stabilization of stellar images.[6]His thesis for a master's degree at MIT concerned stratospheric radiance.[2]
Schweickart was chosen as part ofNASA Astronaut Group 3in October 1963.[7]He was the youngest in the group. The third group of astronauts performed jungle training. Schweickart partnered withClifton Williams.[8]On March 21, 1966, he was named as the backup pilot forRoger B. ChaffeeonApollo 1—which was to have been the first crewed Apollo flight but was destroyed during a ground test accident. His fellow crewmen were backup Command PilotJames McDivittand Senior PilotDavid Scott, both veterans ofProject Gemini.[9]In December 1966, this crew was promoted to fly the first crewed Earth orbital test of theApollo Lunar Module(LM), with Schweickart as Lunar Module Pilot.[10]

Spaceflight experience
The frontier in space, embodied in the space colony, is one in which the interactions between humans and their environment is so much more sensitive and interactive and less tolerant of irresponsibility than it is on the whole surface of the Earth. We are going to learn how to relate to the Earth and our own natural environment here by looking seriously at space colony ecologies.
Apollo 9was flown in March 1969. Schweickart spent just over 241 hours in space, and performed the firstextravehicular activity(EVA) of the Apollo program, testing theportable life support systemthat was later used by the twelve astronauts who walked on the Moon. The flight plan called for him to demonstrate an emergency transfer from the lunar module to thecommand module(CM) using handrails on the LM, but he began to suffer fromspace adaptation syndromeon the first day in orbit, forcing the postponement of the EVA.[10]
Eventually, he improved enough to perform a relatively brief EVA with his feet restrained on the LM "porch" (a platform used in transferring to the descent ladder), while Command Module Pilot Scott performed a stand-up EVA through the open hatch of the CM. During a five-minute pause tethered outside his spacecraft, Schweickart felt he underwent a metaphysical experience as he stared at the Earth, contemplating its place in the universe.[3]He subsequently practicedTranscendental Meditationbased on his experience.[11][12]

Skylab and beyond
AlthoughDeke Slayton(who was responsible for all flight assignments as Director of Flight Crew Operations) opined that Schweickart "would have been a logical lunar module pilot" on subsequent lunar missions—indeed, the standard rotation of the era would have placed him on the backup crew forApollo 12and the prime crew ofApollo 15[13]—"that bout of space sickness had everybody worried ... it didn't seem like a good idea to put him back in ... at this point."[14]Following his mission, Schweickart "basically called the shot that I really didn't want to be assigned to a flight until we knew more about motion sickness" and became "[a] motion sickness guinea pig" for six months; while "[he] didn't learn that much" during the testing, it is now accepted that as many as half of space travelers suffer from space adaptation syndrome to some extent.[15]
The protracted testing period also contributed to Schweickart not being assigned to the Apollo 12 backup crew. When he returned to Houston, "Al Shepard[Slayton's deputy], for whatever reason, instead of putting me back on Apollo, put me on toSkylab... Al had his own agenda of who went where and whatnot. So I cycled into Skylab at the time."[16]Schweickart has also observed that he was "not one of Al's boys", alluding to the politicalliberalismthat he shared with his then-wife, Clare; Slayton felt that her fervent political stances (includingcivil rightsactivism) "caused him a few problems with his colleagues."[14][16]During this period, a Houston radio broadcaster characterized Schweickart as "the closest thing to afreakastronaut" after he was photographed escortingMaharishi Mahesh Yogion a tour of NASA's headquarters.[17]
Along with backup science pilotStory Musgraveand backup pilotBruce McCandless II, Schweickart was assigned as backup commander ofSkylab 2, the first crewed Americanspace stationmission, which flew during the spring of 1973. Following the loss of the space station's thermal shield during launch, he assumed responsibility for the development of hardware and procedures for erecting an emergency solar shade and deploying a jammed solar array wing, operations that saved the space station.[18]
After serving on the support crew ofSkylab 4, Schweickart was more interested in cultivating managerial skills than "[going] over to theSpace Shuttledevelopment work which was under way ... by that time, I had, you know, done a lot of work on Gemini in a support role, and then, of course, everything on Apollo, and now all of this on Skylab, and to go cycle back into the very beginning of the Space Shuttle, which was not going to fly for, at that point, something like six years and best guess of anybody in the business was maybe eight years, I figured, you know, another eight years of basically going to the same kinds of meetings, making the same kinds of decisions, going to the same places ... it was like 'been there, done that.'"[19]
While retaining his flight status, he was reassigned to NASA Headquarters in Washington, D.C. as Director of User Affairs in the Office of Applications in 1974. In this capacity, he was responsible for transferring NASA technology (primarilyLandsat 1applications) to the outside world and working with technology users (including theU.S. Department of Agricultureand water resources managers) to bring an understanding of their needs into NASA. He came to regard this as a "thankless position" and a "very hard sell" to potential clients due to their intrinsic resistance to new processes; this and the dearth of immediate flight opportunities ultimately precipitated his departure from NASA in 1977.[19]

Post-NASA career
Schweickart then served for two years asCalifornia GovernorJerry Brown's assistant for science and technology before being appointed by Brown to theCalifornia Energy Commissionfor five and a half years.[2][3]
Inspired by his friendship withMichael Murphyand involvement in theEsalen Institute's Soviet-American Exchange Program, Schweickart established theAssociation of Space Explorers(ASE) in 1984–85 along withcosmonautsAlexei Leonov,Vitaly Sevastyanov, andGeorgi Grechko; the organization is open to all people who have flown in orbit around the Earth.[2]He also chaired the ASE'snear-Earth objectcommittee, which produced a benchmark report and submitted it to theUnited Nations Committee on the Peaceful Uses of Outer Space(UN COPUOS) onAsteroid Threats: A Call for Global Response.[20]
Schweickart retired from ALOHA Networks, Inc. in 1998 where he served asPresidentandChief Executive Officerfrom 1996 through 1998. ALOHA was a data communications company specializing in high performance, wireless internet access equipment.[2]
Schweickart was formerly the ExecutiveVice Presidentof CTA Commercial Systems, Inc. and Director of Low Earth Orbit (LEO) Systems. Schweickart led CTA's efforts in developing the GEMnet system, a second generation LEO communication satellite constellation designed to provide regular commercial electronic messaging services on a global basis. Prior to his CTA work, Schweickart founded and was President of Courier Satellite Services, Inc., a global satellite communications company that developed LEO satellites to provide worldwide affordable data services.[2]
Schweickart's satellite and telecommunications work involved him in the development of international communications regulations and policies, including participation in the 1992 and 1995World Radiocommunication Conferences(WRC) of theInternational Telecommunication Union(ITU). He served at the 1995 WRC as a U.S. delegate. He also worked extensively in Russia and the formerSoviet Unionon scientific and telecommunications matters.[2]
In 2002 he co-founded theB612 Foundationalong with fellow former-astronautEd Luand two planetary scientists, also serving as its Chair.[21][22]TheB612 Foundationis a non-profit dedicated to defending Earth fromasteroid impacts.[21]
In May 2005 Schweickart testified before theU.S. Congresson the dangers of an asteroid impact related to99942 Apophis. and in 2010 served as the co-chairman, along with astronautTom Jones, NASA Advisory Council'sad hocTask Force on Planetary Defense.[23]He has been an advocate of increasing NASA's annual budget by $250M–$300M over a 10-year period to more fully catalog the NEOs that can pose a threat to Earth and also provide a deflection capability.[24]
Schweickart has also spoken and taught at theEsalen Institute,[25]and currently serves as the B612 Foundation'sChair Emeritus.[22]
