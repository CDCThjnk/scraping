 - Voskhod 2
 - Soyuz 19(Apollo–Soyuz Test Project)
Alexei Arkhipovich Leonov[a](30 May 1934 – 11 October 2019) was a Soviet and Russiancosmonautandaviator,Air Forcemajor general, writer, and artist. On 18 March 1965, he became the first person to conduct aspacewalk, exiting thecapsuleduring theVoskhod 2mission for 12 minutes and 9 seconds. He was also selected to be the first Soviet person toland on the Moonalthough the project was eventually cancelled.
In July 1975, Leonov commanded theSoyuz capsulein theApollo–Soyuzmission, which docked in space for two days with an AmericanApollo capsule.
Leonov was twiceHero of the Soviet Union(1965, 1975),[3]a Major General of Aviation (1975), laureate of theUSSR State Prize(1981), and a member of the Supreme Council of theUnited Russiaparty (2002–2019).

Early life and military service
Leonov was born on 30 May 1934 inListvyanka,West Siberian Krai,Russian SFSR, in aRussianfamily.[4]His grandfather had been forced to relocate to Siberia for his role in the1905 Russian Revolution. Alexei was the eighth of nine surviving children born to YevdokianéeSotnikovaand Arkhip.[b][5]His father was an electrician and miner.[6]
In 1936, his father was arrested and declared an "enemy of the people". Leonov wrote in his autobiography: "He was not alone: many were being arrested. It was part of a conscientious drive by the authorities to eradicate anyone who showed too much independence or strength of character. These were the years ofStalin'spurges. Many disappeared into remotegulagsand were never seen again."[7]
The family moved in with one of his married sisters inKemerovo. His father rejoined the family in Kemerovo after he was released. He was compensated for his wrongful imprisonment.[5]Leonov used art as a way to provide more food for the family. He began his art career by drawing flowers on ovens and later painted landscapes on canvasses.[5]
The Soviet government encouraged its citizens to move to Soviet-occupied Prussia, so in 1948 his family relocated toKaliningrad.[8]Leonov graduated from secondary school (No. 21) in 1953.[8]He applied to the Academy of Arts inRiga, Latvia, but decided not to attend due to the high tuition costs. Leonov decided to join a Ukrainian preparatory flying school inKremenchug. He made his first solo flight in May 1955. While indulging in his passion for art by studying part-time in Riga, Leonov started an advanced two-year course to become a fighter pilot at theChuguevHigher Air Force Pilots School in theUkrainian SSR.[8]
On 30 October 1957, Leonov graduated with an honours degree and was commissioned alieutenantin the 113th Parachute Aviation Regiment, part of the 10th Engineering Aviation Division of the69th Air ArmyinKyiv.[8]On 13 December 1959, he married Svetlana Pavlovna Dozenko.[9]The next day he moved toEast Germanyto his new assignment with the 294th Reconnaissance Regiment of the24th Air Army.[8]

Soviet space program
He was one of the 20Soviet Air Forcespilots selected to be part of the first cosmonaut training group in 1960.[10]As with most cosmonauts, Leonov was a member of theCommunist Party of the Soviet Union. Hiswalk in spacewas originally to have taken place on theVoskhod 1mission, but this was cancelled, and the historic event happened on theVoskhod 2flight instead.[11]He was outside the spacecraft for 12 minutes and nine seconds on 18 March 1965, connected to the craft by a 4.8-metre (16 ft) tether.[10]At the end of the spacewalk, Leonov's spacesuit had inflated in the vacuum of space to the point where he could not re-enter the airlock.[10]He opened a valve to allow some of the suit's pressure to bleed off and was barely able to get back inside the capsule.[10][12]While on the mission, Leonov drew a small sketch of an orbital sunrise, the first work of art made in outer space.[13]Leonov had spent eighteen months undergoingweightlessnesstraining for the mission.[14]
In 1968, Leonov was selected to be commander of a circumlunarSoyuz 7K-L1flight. This was cancelled because of delays in achieving a reliable circumlunar flight (only the laterZond 7andZond 8members of the programme were successful) and theApollo 8mission had already achieved that step in theSpace Race. He was also selected to be the first Soviet person to land on the Moon, aboard theLOK/N1spacecraft.[11]This project was also cancelled. (The design required a spacewalk between lunar vehicles, something that contributed to his selection.) Leonov was to have been commander of the 1971Soyuz 11mission toSalyut 1, the first crewed space station, but his crew was replaced with the backup after one of the members, cosmonautValery Kubasov, was suspected to have contractedtuberculosis(the other member wasPyotr Kolodin).[15]
Leonov was to have commanded the next mission toSalyut 1, but this was scrapped after the deaths of the Soyuz 11 crew members, and the space station was lost.[16]The next two Salyuts (actually the militaryAlmazstation) were lost at launch or failed soon after, and Leonov's crew stood by. By the timeSalyut 4reached orbit, Leonov had been switched to a more prestigious project.[17][18]
Leonov's second trip into space was as commander ofSoyuz 19, the Soviet half of the 1975Apollo-Soyuz mission—the first joint space mission between the Soviet Union and the United States.[17][19]During the project Leonov became lasting friends with the US commanderThomas P. Stafford, with Leonov being the godfather of Stafford's younger children.[20][21]Stafford gave a eulogy in Russian at Leonov's funeral in October 2019.[22][23]
From 1976 to 1982, Leonov was the commander of the cosmonaut team ("Chief Cosmonaut") and deputy director of theYuri Gagarin Cosmonaut Training Center, where he oversaw crew training. He also edited the cosmonaut newsletterNeptune. He retired in 1992.[11]

Later life and death
Leonov was an accomplished artist whose published books include albums of his artistic works and works he did in collaboration with his friendAndrei Sokolov. Leonov took coloured pencils and paper into space, where he sketched the Earth, becoming the firstartist in space, and drew portraits of the Apollo astronauts who flew with him during the 1975Apollo–Soyuz Test Project.[24][25]
Arthur C. Clarkewrote in his notes to his 1982 novel2010: Odyssey Twothat, after a 1968 screening of2001: A Space Odyssey, Leonov pointed out to him that the alignment of the Moon, Earth, and Sun shown in the opening is essentially the same as that in Leonov's 1967 paintingNear the Moon, although the painting's diagonal framing of the scene was not replicated in the film. Clarke kept an autographed sketch of this painting—which Leonov made after the screening—hanging on his office wall.[26]Clarke dedicated2010: Odyssey Twoto Leonov and Soviet physicistAndrei Sakharov.[27]The fictional spaceship in the book is namedCosmonaut Alexei Leonov.[28]
Together with Valentin Selivanov, Leonov wrote the script for the 1980 science fiction filmThe Orion Loop.[29]
Leonov was the head of theBanner of Peacein Space project from 1990 until his death.
Leonov retired in 1991 and lived inMoscow. He had been in reserve since March 1992. In 1992–1993, he was director of space programs at Chetek. Leonov was an advisor to the First Deputy Chairman of the Board of Directors of the Moscow-basedAlfa-Bank, and in 2001, vice-president of Alfa-Bank.[30]He was a member of theUnited Russiaparty since 18 December 2002 and a member of the party's Supreme Council.[31]He received recognition as an artist (he collaborated withAndrei Sokolov), and his works are widely exhibited and published.[32]
In 2004, Leonov and former American astronautDavid Scottbegan work on a dual memoir covering the history of the Space Race between the United States and the Soviet Union. TitledTwo Sides of the Moon: Our Story of the Cold War Space Race, it was published in 2006.Neil ArmstrongandTom Hanksboth wrote introductions to the book.[33]
Leonov was interviewed byFrancis Frenchfor the 2007 bookInto That Silent SeabyColin Burgessand French.[34]
Leonov died in Moscow on 11 October 2019 after a long illness. His funeral took place on 15 October. He was 85[35]and the last living member of the five cosmonauts in theVoskhod programme.[36]He was survived by his wife Svetlana Dozenko, daughter Oksana, and two grandchildren; his other daughter, Viktoria, died in 1996.[37]

Leonov created the design for the reverse side in close cooperation with May.[43]
 - The 2017 filmThe Age of Pioneers(Russian:Vremya Pervykh) is based on Leonov's account of the Voskhod 2 mission.
