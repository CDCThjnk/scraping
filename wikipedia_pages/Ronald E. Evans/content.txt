Ronald Ellwin Evans Jr.(November 10, 1933 – April 7, 1990) was an Americanelectrical engineer,aeronautical engineer, officer andaviatorin theUnited States Navy, andNASA astronaut.[1]AsCommand Module PilotonApollo 17he was one of the 24 astronauts to fly to the Moon, and one of12 people to fly to the Moon without landing.
Before becoming an astronaut, Evans graduated with aBachelor of Sciencedegree inelectrical engineeringfrom theUniversity of Kansasand joined the U.S. Navy in 1956. After receiving his naval aviatorwings, he served as afighter pilotand flewcombatmissions during theVietnam War. In 1964 he received aMaster of Sciencedegree inaeronautical engineeringfrom the U.S.Naval Postgraduate School. Achieving the rank ofcaptain, he retired from the Navy in 1976.
Evans was selected as an astronaut by NASA as part ofNASA Astronaut Group 5in 1966 and made his onlyspaceflightas command Module pilot aboard Apollo 17 in December 1972, the last crewed mission to theMoon, with CommanderGene CernanandLunar ModulePilotHarrison Schmitt. During the flight, Evansand five miceorbited the Moon a record 75 times as his two crewmates descended to and explored the surface. He is the last person to orbit the Moon alone and, at 147 hours and 43 minutes, holds the record for the most time spent in lunar orbit. During Apollo 17's return flight to Earth, Evans performed anextravehicular activity(EVA) to retrieve film cassettes from theservice module. It was the third "deep space" EVA, and is the spacewalk performed at the greatest distance from any planetary body. As of 2025[update], it remains one of only three deep space EVAs, all made during theApollo program'sJ-missions. It was the final spacewalk of the Apollo program.
In 1975, Evans served as backup Command Module Pilot for theApollo–Soyuz Test Projectmission. He worked on the development of theSpace Shuttlebefore retiring from NASA in March 1977 to become a coal industry executive. Evans died from a heart attack in 1990, aged 56.

Early life and education
Ronald Ellwin Evans was born on November 10, 1933, inSt. Francis, Kansas,[2]the son of Clarence Ellwin "Jim" Evans (1911–1985) and his wife Marie A. (néePriebe; 1913–1992).[3]He had two younger siblings, Larry Joe Evans and Jay Evans.[4]He was active in theBoy Scouts of Americawhere he achieved its second highest rank,Life Scout.[5]He attended St. Francis Elementary School. His father served in theUnited States NavyduringWorld War II. Evans started his secondary education at St. Francis High School, but only attended for two months before the family moved toTopeka, Kansasto seek medical treatment for his brother Larry, who was diagnosed withliver cancer. Larry died in 1951, and his parents separated. Evans attendedHighland Park High Schoolin Topeka, where he served on the Student Council, and was the president of the Science Club. He was a member of the schoolAmerican footballteam,[6]and was an All-Conferenceguard.[3]His other brother, Dale, secured a football scholarship toKansas State Universitywhere he playedcollege football, and later played professionally for theDenver Broncos. Later Dale served two tours of duty in Vietnam with theUnited States Marine Corps.[7]
Evans decided to studyelectrical engineeringat theUniversity of Kansas. His application was accepted, and he was offered a place starting in September 1951. His family had little money, so in order to pay for his college education he secured a scholarship from theNaval Reserve Officers Training Corps(NROTC). During the fraternities'rush weekhe joined theSigma Nufraternity. He earned extra money sellingChesterfieldcigarettes, and had a cigarette vending machine installed in the Sigma Nu fraternity house. NROTC training involved a parade for one hour each week, and during the summer break there were midshipman cruises on warships. The first was on thebattleshipUSSWisconsin. In hissophomoreyear there was an introduction to naval aviation atNaval Air Station Corpus Christiin Texas. This experience inspired Evans to become anaval aviator. The third year cruise was to Europe on theUSSGwin, adestroyer minelayer. In hisjunior yearhe was elected to theSigma Tau,Tau Beta PiandSigma Xiengineering honor societies. During his final summer break he worked in a glass factory to gain general engineering experience. He graduated with hisBachelor of Sciencedegree in electrical engineering in June 1956.[8]

Navy
In a letter dated December 12, 1955, the Navy offered Evans a commission as anensignand designated him a student aviator. He reported toNaval Air Station Pensacolain February 1956 for basic flight training in theBeechcraft T-34 Mentor, and made his first solo flight on May 21. He then progressed to the more powerfulNorth American T-28 Trojan. His flight training then moved toNaval Outlying Landing Field BarininAlabama, where student aviators practised landing on anaircraft carrierusing an outline painted on the runway in the oldNorth American T-6 Texan(known as the SNJ). Six actual landings were then made on the aircraft carrierUSSSaipan.[9]Evans returned to Topeka for Christmas leave. There he met Janet Merle (Jan) Pollom, who worked as a secretary atForbes Air Force Base, and fell in love with her.[10][3]On January 4, 1957, he reported toNaval Air Station Memphis, where he was taught instrument flying, culminating in aground-controlled approachtest. He then learned how to fly a jet aircraft, theLockheed T-33 Shooting Star. In a ceremony on April 12 attended by Pollom, her mother, and Evans's mother, the chief of the Naval Air Technical Training Command,Rear AdmiralFrank P. Akershanded out certificates to Evans's class designating them as naval aviator. Pollom pinned hisaviator wingson his uniform.[11]
Evans became afighter pilotwith Fighter Squadron 142 (VF-142), which was based atNaval Air Station MiramarinCalifornia, although it was still aboard the aircraft carrierUSSHornetwhen he arrived on July 14, 1957, and did not reach Miramar until July 25. The squadron was due to receive the newVought F8U Crusaderfighter, but these had not yet arrived, and in the meantime they flew the oldNorth American FJ-3 Fury.[12]He was promoted to the rank oflieutenant (junior grade), and married Pollom at theWestminster Presbyterian Church of Topekaon December 22, 1957. They had two children: a daughter, Jaime Dayle, and a son, Jon.[13]
In January 1959, VF-142 boarded the brand new aircraft carrierUSSRanger, and set off on a cruise of the Western Pacific, which lasted until July 27, 1959.[14]Afterwards, most of VF-142 was posted elsewhere, and Evans was one of the five pilots that remained. They took delivery of new model F8U Crusaders, and were joined by new pilots who had to be trained to fly them. The squadron was then assigned to the aircraft carrierUSSOriskany, which departed for a tour of the Western Pacific on May 14, and returned toSan Diegoon December 15. During the voyage, Evans completed correspondence coursework for promotion tolieutenant, and was promoted to that rank in June.[15]With the completion of back to back deployments, he became aflight instructorfor the F8U Crusader with Fighter Squadron 124 (VF-124), but until it moved to Miramar in June, he had to fly theGrumman F9F Cougar, although he was able to fly the F8U Crusader once a week or so to stay familiar with it.[16]
In 1962, Evans entered the U.S.Naval Postgraduate SchoolinMonterey, California. Fellow students there at the time includedRobert H. Shumaker,Gene Cernan,Richard F. Gordon Jr.,Paul J. WeitzandJack Lousma.[16][17]On June 5, 1963, theNational Aeronautics and Space Administration(NASA) announced that it would be recruitinga new groupofastronauts.  Military applications were due by July 15.[18]They were pre-screened by the services,[19]and those that the Navy regarded as qualified were contacted and invited to apply.[20]Evans was on leave in Topeka, and received this notification in the form of atelegram. He submitted the required paperwork on July 6.[21]Cernan, Evans, Gordon and Shumaker were among the 34 finalists that NASA invited to undergo a week of medical and physiological tests atBrooks Air Force BaseinSan Antonio, Texas.[22]Six were eliminated at this point; the remaining 28, including Evans, were invited to come toHouston, Texasfor interviews and testing.[23][24]On October 14, Cernan and Evans were both called out of class to take long distance calls from NASA. For Cernan, it was a call fromDeke Slayton, NASA's Director of Space Flight Operations, informing that he had been chosen; for Evans, it was one fromAl Shepard, informing him that he had not.[25]Evans returned to his studies. The Navy frowned on officers loafing while still drawing pay during the summer break, so the students had to take summer classes. Evans chose to take a course in Russian at theDefense Language Instituteat thePresidio of Monterey.[21]He graduated with aMaster of Sciencedegree inaeronautical engineeringin 1964.[2]
After two years ashore, Evans rejoined VF-124 to re-qualify for aircraft carrier duty.[26]He was then assigned to Fighter Squadron 51 (VF-51), once again flying the F8U Crusader. The ship was already engaged in  a combat tour of the Western Pacific on board the aircraft carrierUSSTiconderoga, an older sister ship of theOriskany, so Evans was flown toNaval Air Station Cubi Pointin the Philippines, where he collected an F8U Crusader that had been set aside for him, and flew out to the ship.[27]TheTiconderogareturned to San Diego in December 1964. Evans was appointed the squadron maintenance officer, a position usually held by alieutenant commander, and soon after received a spot promotion to that rank.[28]
TheTiconderogadeparted for its next Western Pacific cruise in September 1965, but this was not a normal peacetime cruise; theTiconderogawas assigned toDixie Stationoff the coast ofSouth Vietnam, from whence aircraft carriers launched strikes in support of American and South Vietnamese troops engaged in combat operations in theVietnam War. During a training exercise, Evans collided with his wingman, Lieutenant Roy E. Miller. Evans had to land atTan Son Nhut Air Basebecause his aircraft was too badly damaged to be recovered by an aircraft carrier, and it had to be shipped back to the United States for repairs. It was seen by his wife, who recorded a duet ofSide by Sidewith Miller's wife, adding to the ribbing Evans received from his shipmates. Within days he was flying combat missions over South Vietnam. Ordnance was in short supply, so in order to inflate the number ofsortiesflown, aircraft seldom carried full bomb loads. Evans's aircraft was holed by ground fire.[28]
On September 10, 1965, NASA announced that it was recruitinganother group of pilot astronauts.[29]Once again, theBureau of Naval Personnel(BUPERS) contacted Evans and asked if he wanted to volunteer, which he did. On November 12, a package of forms was received by his wife Jan in San Diego, with a cover letter that explained that BUPERS had recommended Evans to NASA. She contacted Slayton, and explained that Evans was on a deployment in the Western Pacific, and was unlikely to be able to return the forms before the December 1 deadline. Slayton reassured her that this would be taken into consideration. Evans managed to mail the forms on December 7. A few weeks later a letter arrived informing Evans that once again he had made the short list, and was invited to come to Brooks Air Force Base for another round of tests.[30]
Ticonderogawas back on Dixie station by January 28, and Evans was flying attack missions againstViet Conginsurgents. On that day, his aircraft suffered an electrical failure and he was left with a bomb under his right wing that he was unable to jettison. This made it too dangerous to attempt a landing on theTiconderoga, so he was ordered to proceed toCam Ranh Air Force Base, Evans skidded on the wetMarston Matrunway and went 6.1 metres (20 ft) off its end. The bomb did not explode. Evans was taken to the office of the base commander, where aUnited States Air Forcesergeant handed him orders to proceed to Texas for astronaut selection. Once again, Evans endured the battery of medical and psychological tests, and was chosen as one of the 35 finalists to be interviewed at theRice Hotel. Histemporary duty assignmentonly covered the tests, but BUPERS extended it to March 5, and then turned down his squadron commander's request for a replacement officer. As it happened, Evans did not miss much action, as theTiconderogadepartedSubic Bayin the Philippines forSasebo, Japan, on February 17, but it was back on Dixie Station by March 6. Eleven days later, Evans participated in an attack on Viet Cong units that earned him aNavy Commendation Medal. On March 26, he received word that he had been selected for astronaut training.[31]He was one of the nineteen astronauts selected by NASA in April 1966.[32]
Evans completed a seven-month tour of duty flyingcombat missions. In his Navy service, Evans had logged 2,084 hours of flight time, including 4,600 hours injet aircraft.[33]He had flown 112 combat missions. In a ceremony on theTiconderoga'sflight deckon April 1, he was awarded gold5/16 inch starsin lieu of his second, third, fourth and fifthAir Medals. He flew his last mission, acombat air patrol, on April 21.[34]

NASA

Support crew
TheTiconderogaleft Dixie station on April 21, 1966, and returned to San Diego on May 16. Evans preceded it, after taking a mail plane to the Philippines, and then aMilitary Air Transport Serviceflight to San Diego, which he reached on April 28. He then took a flight to Houston on May 1. The family remained in San Diego until his daughter Jaime finished her school year in late May. In the meantime Evans and Jan bought a four-bedroom house inEl Lago, Texas. It was newly built, with no furniture, and the electricity and telephone still to be connected. The family set out for Houston on June 6, taking four days to make the journey in theirRamblerstation wagon. As their furniture had not yet arrived, they initially stayed in quarters atEllington Air Force Base. The family was finally able to move in on July 6. Evans's Navy Commendation Medal citation was forwarded to NASA, and the medal was presented to him, along with a silver 5/16 inch star in lieu of his sixth Air Medal and gold 5/16 inch stars in lieu of his seventh and eighth, byRobert Gilruth, the director of NASA'sManned Spacecraft Center.[35]
In earlier astronaut groups, the senior astronaut had assumed the role ofcommand module pilot(CMP) while the more junior was the lunar module pilot (LMP), but the Nineteen were divided intoCommand/Service Module(CSM) andLunar Module(LM) specialists. Slayton asked each of the Nineteen which speciality he preferred, but made the final decision himself. This early division of assignments would have a profound effect on their subsequent careers. Evans became a CSM specialist.[36]He was chosen as a member of the support crew forApollo 1, the first crewedProject Apollomission, along withEd GivensandJack Swigert, two fellow members of his astronaut group. The astronauts assigned to this duty regarded it as the lowest rung on the ladder.[37]Usually low in seniority, they assembled the mission's rules,flight plan, and checklists, and kept them updated, and worked in the simulators developing procedures, especially those for emergency situations. They also stood by during spacecraft tests on the launch pad, and set up the cockpit, ensuring that all the switches were in the right positions.[38][39]In this role, Evans worked inside the Apollo spacecraft for a couple of hours on January 26, 1967. The support crew then flew back to Houston. On landing at Ellington Air Force Base they were informed that the prime crew had died in a fire inside the spacecraft.[40]
When planning for Apollo missions resumed, Evans, Givens and Swigert were assigned to the support crew ofApollo 7, which would now be the first crewed flight.[39]Givens was killed in a motor vehicle accident on June 6, 1967,[41]and was replaced on the support crew byBill Pogue.[39][42]Evans was subsequently a member of the support crew forApollo 11, the first Moon landing,[43]and he was acapsule communicator(CAPCOM) for Apollo 7, Apollo 11 andApollo 14.[43]

Backup crew
Under the rotation scheme developed by Slayton, the role of backup commander (CDR) for Apollo 13 would have beenJohn Young, the CMP ofApollo 10, and that of Apollo 14 would have been the CMP of Apollo 11,Michael Collins. They would then become the prime crew CDRs ofApollo 16andApollo 17respectively. However, Cernan baulked at reprising his role as LMP  with Young, holding out for his own mission. This became available when Collins declined the opportunity to lead a mission to the Moon. Cernan was therefore selected as backup CDR of Apollo 14 in his stead.[44][45]This was fortunate for Evans as well; Slayton consulted with Cernan about the selection of the rest of his Apollo 14 backup crew, and they chose Evans as CMP andJoe Engleas LMP.[46]The prime crew for Apollo 14 would beAlan Shepard, theChief of the Astronaut Officeas CDR,Edgar Mitchellas LMP andStu Roosaas CMP. Evans's selection as a member of the Apollo 14 backup crew was formally announced by NASA on August 6, 1969.[47]He was still a serving naval officer, and on October 1, 1969, was promoted tocommander.[45]
That the backup crew of Apollo 14 would in due course become the prime crew of Apollo 17 as per the rotation scheme was far from certain. The absence of science astronauts on the prime or backup crews of Apollo 13 and Apollo 14 caused adverse reaction in the media, and there was pressure from the scientific community to send a scientist to the Moon.[48]When Slayton announced the crew forApollo 15on March 26, 1970,geologistastronautHarrison Schmittwas named as backup LMP, withVance Brandas backup CMP and Richard Gordon as backup CDR. Under the rotation scheme, they could expect to become the prime crew forApollo 18.[49]
When Apollo 18 was cancelled in September 1970, the scientific community pressed NASA to assign Schmitt, a geologist, to Apollo 17 rather than a pilot with non-professional geological training. This left Slayton with the question of who would fill the two other Apollo 17 slots: the rest of the Apollo 15 backup crew or the Apollo 14 backup crew (except for Engle). Gordon's crew's experience as backup to Apollo 15 was more relevant for the proposed Apollo 17 mission, as Apollo 15 was a similar J-class mission using the Extended Lunar Module, capable of three-day stays on the Moon, and carrying theLunar Roving Vehicle. Nor was support for assigning Cernan to Apollo 17 unanimous within NASA;Tom Stafford, the acting chief of the Astronaut office with Shepard assigned to Apollo 14, strongly supported Cernan, with whom he had flown onGemini 9Aand Apollo 10, as did Shepard; but Gordon was supported byJames McDivitt, the manager of the Apollo Spacecraft Program Office, andPete Conrad, who had been Gordon's CDR on Apollo 12. Cernan crashed aBell 47G helicopterinto theIndian RivernearCape Canaveralduring a training exercise in January 1971; the accident was attributed to pilot error, as Cernan had misjudged his altitude before crashing into the water. Slayton dismissed concerns about Cernan's judgment. After being offered command of the mission, Cernan objected to Engle's omission from the crew, but acquiesced when it became clear that Schmitt would fly on Apollo 17 with or without Cernan. The fate of the CMP was tied to that of his CDR.[50][51][52]
The prime crew of Apollo 17 was publicly announced on August 13, 1971.[53]The original backup crew for Apollo 17, announced at the same time, was the crew of Apollo 15:David Scottas CDR,Alfred Wordenas CMP andJames Irwinas LMP;[53]but they were removed because of their roles in theApollo 15 postal covers incident.[54]On May 23, 1972, they were replaced with Young and Duke from the crew of Apollo 16, as backup CDR and LMP respectively, and Roosa from the Apollo 14 crew as backup CMP. Thus, Evans served as Roosa's backup on Apollo 14, and Roosa as Evans's backup on Apollo 17.[55][56][57][58]The two men studied geology withFarouk El-Baz, often on their own time. They became close friends. They would talk about the Moon and the mission at length, and often end with a few beers.[59]Their training was directed at developing the ability to make observations and take photographs of features from orbit. They would fly over geological features in NASANorthrop T-38 Talonjets and tape record their observations and take photographs. These would then be critiqued by geologists.[60]Farouk sometimes flew with Evans or Roosa in the T-38s or smallUnited States Geological Surveyaircraft.[61]

Prime crew
While suited up for the Apollo 17 mission, but before his helmet was attached, Evans smoked a last cigarette. His crewmates had urged him to quit, and Schmitt suggested that he could take advantage of the two-week mission to gocold turkey.[62]An estimated 700,000 people watched the night launch from theKennedy Space Center, the largest crowd of spectators since Apollo 11.[63]The flight plan kept Evans busy, making him so tired he overslept one morning by an hour, despite the efforts of Mission Control to awaken him. Before the LM departed for the lunar surface, he had discovered that he had misplaced his pair of scissors, necessary to open food packets. Cernan and Schmitt lent him one of theirs.[64]While Cernan and Schmitt landed on the Moon and explored theTaurus–Littrow valley, Evans remained in lunar orbit on board the Command ModuleAmerica, completing assigned work tasks which required visual geological observations, hand-held photography of specific targets, and the control of cameras and other highly sophisticated scientific equipment carried in the service module'sSIM bay.[2]Cernan and Schmitt referred to Evans as "Captain America", after thecomic book character.[65]
The orbit of the CSM having been modified to an elliptical orbit in preparation for the LM's departure and eventual descent, one of Evans's first solo tasks in the CSM was to circularize its orbit such that the CSM would remain at approximately the same distance above the surface throughout its orbit. Thereafter, he observed ten visual targets that had been assigned prior to launch, all of which were successfully identified during the course of the mission. He focused on surface features as well as thesolar coronaat "sunrise," or the period of time during which the CSM would pass from the darkened portion of the Moon to the illuminated portion when the Moon itself mostly obscured the sun. To photograph portions of the surface that were not illuminated by the sun while Evans passed over them, Evans relied in conjunction onexposureandEarthlight. Evans photographed such features as the cratersEratosthenesand Copernicus, as well as the vicinity ofMare Orientale, using this technique.[66]According to the Apollo 17 Mission Report, Evans was able to capture all scientific photographic targets, as well as some other targets of interest.[67]
The instruments in the SIM bay functioned without significant hindrance during the orbital portion of the mission, though the two antennas of the lunar sounder as well as the mapping camera encountered minor issues. The indicator on the instrument panel for the extension of one of the sounder's antennas was not functional and the second antenna suffered an apparent stall during its extension. Despite these technical difficulties, both antennas were deployed fully and the sounder achieved its planned observational purpose. Similarly, the extension and retraction of the mapping camera took longer than planned (about four minutes, longer than the nominal two) and, though deployment and retraction was not otherwise hindered, the use of this piece of equipment was reduced to avoid exhausting it by overuse.[68]
Evans was also responsible for piloting the CSM during the orbital phase of the mission, maneuvering the spacecraft to alter and maintain its orbital trajectory. In addition to the initial orbital recircularization maneuver shortly after the LM's departure, one of the final significant solo activities Evans performed in the CSM in preparation for the return of his crewmates from the lunar surface was theplane changemaneuver. This maneuver was meant to align the CSM's trajectory to the eventual trajectory of the LM to facilitate rendezvous in orbit. Evans fired the SPS engine of the CSM for about 20 seconds in successfully adjusting the CSM's orbital plane.[68]He holds the record of most time spent inlunar orbit: 147 hours, 43 minutes and 37.11 seconds.[69][70]
Hot diggety dog!
On the way back to Earth, Evans completed a one-hour, five-minute, 44-secondextravehicular activity, during which he made three trips to the scientific instrument module (SIM) bay to retrieve lunar sounder film, the panoramic camera, and three camera mapping cassettes, and completed a personal inspection of the equipment bay area.[69]For this Evans donned Cernan's lunar visor assembly with its red stripe, and the top part of his lunar backpack. He set up the movie camera and TV camera to record the EVA, allowing it to be televised live.[72]After a flight of 301 hours, 51 minutes and 59 seconds,Americasplashed down in the Pacific Ocean, where it was retrieved by theTiconderoga.[73]To the dismay of his Apollo 17 crewmates, the first thing that Evans did when he got on board was ask one of the crew for a cigarette.[74]
Astronauts normally received a spot promotion on the successful completion of a mission; Evans's promotion tocaptainwas made official in January 1973. He received his Navyastronaut wingsfromJohn Warner, theUnited States Secretary of the Navy. The Apollo 17 crew were fêted at parties and receptions. They were driven around theLos Angeles Memorial ColiseumatSuper Bowl VII, they met Elvis Presley in Las Vegas and were hosted by PresidentRichard Nixonat theWhite HouseandCamp David. Cernan and Evans refused to meet withMuhammad Alibecause of the boxer's 1967 refusal to serve in the U.S. armed forces, but accepted hospitality fromFrank Sinatra.[75]
Evans was later backup CMP for the 1975Apollo–Soyuz Test Project(ASTP) mission.[70]The Russian he had learned years before came in handy, but was limited. Asked to give a speech at a cosmonauts' dinner event, he recitedHumpty Dumptyin Russian, which his hosts found hilarious.[76]Evans retired from the U.S. Navy as captain on April 30, 1976, with 21 years of service, but remained active as a NASA astronaut involved in the development of NASA'sSpace Shuttle program.[70][2]He served as a member of the operations and training group within the Astronaut Office, responsible for launch and ascent phases of theSpace Shuttleprogram.[70]He retired from NASA on March 8, 1977.[77]

Later years
Jan's parents had retired to live inSun City, Arizona, and Jan was eager to move to nearbyScottsdale, Arizona, so Evans looked for a job there. A chance encounter led to an offer to become the director of  marketing at the Scottsdale-based Western America Energy Corporation. Evans soon became disillusioned with the company and the industry and quit. He then found a position withSperry Flight Systems, which made electronic components and cockpit instrumentation for the Space Shuttle, as its Director of Space Systems Marketing. But the president of the company who had brought him in died, and Evans had a falling out with his successor. He left to form his own consulting company, and formed a lucrative partnership with a Japanese entrepreneur who was building a theme park devoted to space exploration.[78]
Evans died in his sleep of aheart attackat his home in Scottsdale on April 7, 1990, at the age of 56.[79][80]He was buried at the Valley Presbyterian Church Memorial Garden inParadise Valley, Arizona, where Jan would leave a red rose on the anniversaries of his birth, marriage, spaceflight and death.[81]

Awards and honors
Evans was awarded theNASA Distinguished Service Medalin 1973,[82]theJohnson Space CenterSuperior Achievement Award in 1970, theNavy Distinguished Service Medalin 1973, Navy Astronaut Wings, eight Air Medals, theVietnam Service Medal, and the Navy Commendation Medal with combat distinguishing service.[83]He received a University of Kansas Distinguished Service Citation in 1973, and was named Kansan of the Year in 1972.[84]He was inducted into theInternational Space Hall of Famein 1983,[83][85]and theU.S. Astronaut Hall of Fameon October 4, 1997.[86][87]
