She later formed a non-profit educational foundation and through the foundation is the principal of the100 Year Starshipproject funded byDARPA. Jemison also wrote several books for children and appeared on television several times, including ina 1993 episodeofStar Trek: The Next Generation. She holds severalhonorary doctoratesand has been inducted into theNational Women's Hall of Fameand theInternational Space Hall of Fame.

Early life and education
Mae Carol Jemison was born inDecatur, Alabama, on October 17, 1956,[1][2]the youngest of three children of Charlie Jemison and Dorothy Jemison (néeGreen).[3]Her father was a maintenance supervisor for a charity organization, and her mother worked most of her career as an elementary school teacher of English and math at the Ludwig van Beethoven Elementary School inChicago, Illinois.[4][5]The family first lived inWoodlawnand later theMorgan Parkneighborhoods.[6]Jemison knew from a young age that she wanted to study science and someday go into space.[7]The television showStar Trekand, in particular, African-American actressNichelle Nichols' portrayal of LieutenantUhurafurther stoked her interest in space.[8][9][10]
Jemison enjoyed studying nature andhuman physiology, using her observations to learn more about science. Although her mother encouraged her curiosity[8]and both her parents were supportive of her interest in science, she did not always see the same support from her teachers.[11]When Jemison told a kindergarten teacher she wanted to be a scientist when she grew up, the teacher assumed she meant she wanted to be a nurse.[12]Seeing a lack of female astronauts during theApollo missionsalso frustrated Jemison. She later recalled, "everybody was thrilled about space, but I remember being really really irritated that there were no women astronauts."[7]
Jemison began studying ballet at the age of 8 or 9 and entered high school at 12 years old, where she joined the cheerleading team and the Modern Dance Club.[13][14]Jemison had a great love for dance from a young age. She learned several styles of dance, includingAfricanandJapanese, as well asballet,jazz, andmodern dance. As a child, Jemison had aspirations of becoming a professional dancer.[15]At the age of 14, she auditioned for the leading role of Maria inWest Side Story. She did not get the leading role but was selected as a background dancer.[16]
After graduating from Chicago'sMorgan Park High Schoolin 1973,[12]Jemison enteredStanford Universityat the age of 16.[8]Although she was young to be leaving home for college, Jemison later said it did not faze her because she was "naive and stubborn enough".[8]There were very few other African-American students in Jemison's classes and she continued to experience discrimination from her teachers.[17]In an interview withThe Des Moines Registerin 2008, Jemison said that it was difficult to go to Stanford at 16 but that her youthful arrogance may have helped her;[18]she asserted that some arrogance is necessary for women and minorities to be successful in a white male dominated society.[18]
At Stanford, Jemison served as head of theBlack Students Union.[11]She alsochoreographeda musical and dance production calledOut of the Shadows.[19]During her senior year in college, she struggled with the choice between going to medical school or pursuing a career as a professional dancer after graduation;[20]she graduated from Stanford in 1977, receiving aB.S.degree inchemical engineering.[1][8]andB.A.degree inAfricanandAfrican-American studies.[21]While at Stanford, she also pursued studies related to her childhood interest in space and first considered applying to NASA.[22]

Medical career
Jemison attendedCornell Medical Schooland during her training, traveled to Cuba, to conduct a study funded byAmerican Medical Student Associationand to Thailand, where she worked at a Cambodianrefugee camp.[23][21]She also worked forFlying Doctorsstationed in East Africa.[21]During her years at Cornell, Jemison continued to study dance by enrolling in classes at theAlvin Ailey American Dance Theater.[13]After graduating with anM.D.degree in 1981, she interned atLos Angeles County-USC Medical Centerin 1982, and worked as a general practitioner forRoss–Loos Medical Group.[1][21]
Jemison joined the staff of thePeace Corpsin 1983 and served as a medical officer until 1985. She was responsible for the health of Peace Corps volunteers serving inLiberiaandSierra Leone.[20][1]Jemison supervised the Peace Corps' pharmacy, laboratory, medical staff as well as providing medical care, writing self-care manuals, and developing and implementing guidelines for health and safety issues. She also worked with theCenters for Disease Controlhelping with research for various vaccines.[24]

NASA career
Upon returning to the United States after serving in the Peace Corps, Jemison settled inLos Angeles, California. In Los Angeles, she entered into private practice and took graduate-level engineering courses. Inspired by the flights ofSally RideandGuion Blufordin 1983, Jemison applied to the astronaut program in October 1985.[4]After NASA postponed selection of new candidates after theSpace ShuttleChallengerdisasterin 1986, Jemison reapplied in 1987. She was chosen out of roughly 2,000 applicants for 15 slots inNASA Astronaut Group 12, the first selected afterChallenger.[11]TheAssociated Presscovered her as the "first black woman astronaut" in 1987.[25]CBSfeatured Jemison as one of the country's "most eligible singles" onBest Catches, a television special hosted byPhylicia RashadandRobb Wellerin 1989.[26]
Jemison's work with NASA before her shuttle launch included launch support activities at theKennedy Space Centerin Florida and verification of Shuttle computer software in theShuttle Avionics Integration Laboratory(SAIL).[27][28]On September 28, 1989, she was selected to join theSTS-47crew asMission Specialist4 and was also designated Science Mission Specialist, a new astronaut role being tested by NASA to focus on scientific experiments.[29]

STS-47
Jemison flew her only space mission from September 12 to 20, 1992, as one of the seven-member crew aboard Space ShuttleEndeavour,[4][30]on mission STS-47, a cooperative mission between the United States and Japan, as well as the 50th shuttle mission.[31]Jemison logged 190 hours, 30 minutes, 23 seconds in space and orbited the earth 127 times.[32][33]The crew was split into two shifts with Jemison assigned to the Blue Shift. Throughout the eight-day mission, she began communications on her shift with the salute "Hailing frequencies open", a quote fromStar Trek.[34]Jemison took a poster from theAlvin Ailey American Dance Theateralong with her on the flight.[8][35]She also took a West African statuette[8]and a photo of pioneering aviatorBessie Coleman, the first African American with an internationalpilot license.[36][8]
STS-47 carried theSpacelabJapan module, a cooperative mission between the United States and Japan that included 43 Japanese and United States life science and materials processing experiments.[29]Jemison and Japanese astronautMamoru Mohriwere trained to use the Autogenic Feedback Training Exercise (AFTE),[37]a technique developed byPatricia S. Cowingsthat usesbiofeedbackandautogenic trainingto help patients monitor and control their physiology as a possible treatment formotion sickness,anxietyandstress-related disorders.[38][39]
Aboard the Spacelab Japan module, Jemison tested NASA's Fluid Therapy System, a set of procedures and equipment to producewater for injection, developed by Sterimatics Corporation. She then usedIV bagsand a mixing method, developed byBaxter Healthcare, to use the water from the previous step to producesaline solutionin space.[40]Jemison was also a co-investigator of twobone cellresearch experiments.[24]Another experiment she participated in was to induce female frogs to ovulate, fertilize the eggs, and then see howtadpolesdeveloped in zero gravity.[41]

Resignation from NASA
Jemison resigned from NASA in March 1993 to start a company.[30][20][42]NASA training manager and authorHomer Hickam, who had trained Jemison for her flight, later expressed some regret that she had departed.[8]

Post-NASA career
Jemison served on the board of directors of the World Sickle Cell Foundation from 1990 to 1992.[7]In 1993, she founded The Jemison Group Inc., a consulting firm which considers thesocioculturalimpact of technological advancements and design.[2][43]
Jemison also founded the Dorothy Jemison Foundation for Excellence, naming it in honor of her mother.[44]One of the projects of the foundation isThe Earth We Share, a science camp for students aged 12 to 16. Founded in 1994,[45]camps have been held atDartmouth College,Colorado School of Mines,Choate Rosemary Halland other sites in the United States,[44]as well as internationally in South Africa, Tunisia, and Switzerland.[46]Jemison stated that the goal of these four-week long, residential programs is to increase scientific literacy by developing the students’ abilities in both critical thinking and problem solving. Students accomplish this by working in teams and using thescientific methodto identify and solve a real problem facing their communities.[47]The Dorothy Jemison Foundation also sponsors other events and programs, including the Shaping the World essay competition, Listening to the Future (a survey program that targets obtaining opinions from students), Earth Online (an online chatroom that allows students to safely communicate and discuss ideas on space and science), and the Reality Leads Fantasy Gala.[48]
