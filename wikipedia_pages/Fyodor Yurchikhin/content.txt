Experience
After graduating from the S. Ordzhonikidze Moscow Aviation Institute, Yurchikhin worked at theRussian Space Corporation Energiafrom September 1983 until August 1997. He began working as a controller in theRussian Mission Control Center, and held the positions of engineer, senior engineer, and lead engineer, eventually becoming a lead engineer forShuttle-MirandNASA-Mirprograms.[6]

Roscosmos career
In August 1997, he was enrolled in theRSC Energiacosmonaut detachment as a cosmonaut-candidate. From January 1998 to November 1999, he completed his basic training course. In November 1999, he was qualified as a test cosmonaut. In January 2000, he started training in the test-cosmonaut group for theInternational Space Station(ISS) program.

STS-112
Yurchikhin was a crewmember of the International Space Station assembly missionSTS-112conducted usingSpace ShuttleAtlantis.[7]During the mission the shuttle crew conducted joint operations with theExpedition 5by delivering and installing the S1 Truss (the third piece of the station's 11-pieceIntegrated Truss Structure). Threespacewalkswere required to outfit and activate the new component. The crew also transferred cargo between the two vehicles and used the shuttle's thruster jets during two maneuvers to raise the station's orbit. STS-112 was the first shuttle mission to use a camera on the External Tank, providing a live view of the launch to flight controllers and NASA TV viewers. The STS-112 mission was accomplished in 170 orbits, traveling 7,200,000 km (4,500,000 mi) in 10 days, 19 hours, and 58 minutes.[8]

Expedition 15
In 2007, he became a member of theExpedition 15on the ISS. His flight began on April 7, when he launched from theBaikonur Cosmodrome, aboardSoyuz TMA-10spacecraft, together withOleg Kotovand space touristCharles Simonyi. Yurchikhin was aboard when Simonyi gave a live telebridge conversation on 17 April 2007. He served as the commander of the Expedition 15 mission.
On 21 October 2007, he returned toEarthinside theSoyuz TMA-10capsule after spending 196 days and 17 hours in space. The Soyuz TMA-10 spacecraft undocked from the ISS at 07:14 UTC on 21 October 2007, and deorbit occurred at 09:47 UTC. Duringatmospheric re-entry, the spacecraft transitioned to aballistic reentry, resulting in it landing west ofArkalyk, approximately 340 km (210 mi) northwest of the intendedKazakhstanlanding site.[9]

Expedition 24/25
Yurchikhin served as a flight engineer for theExpedition 24/25long-duration missions to the ISS. On 16 June 2010, Yurchikhin along with NASA astronautsDouglas WheelockandShannon Walkerlifted off aboard theSoyuz TMA-19spacecraft from theBaikonur Cosmodrome. He also served as the commander of theSoyuz TMA-19spacecraft.
During his second long stay aboard the ISS, Yurhikhin participated in two spacewalks in support of station's maintenance and staging new experiments in the exterior of the orbiting complex. On 26 July 2010, Yurchikhin and fellow Russian cosmonautMikhail Kornienkoperformed a spacewalk outside the space station. On 15 November 2010, Yurchikhin again participated in a spacewalk with cosmonaut and Expedition 25/26 flight engineerOleg Skripochka.
On 18 October 2010, Yurchikhin took part in the all-Russian census from space. He answered questions for the census collectors during a linkup with the Mission Control Center outsideMoscow.[10]
Yurchikhin returned to Earth on 26 November 2010 after spending 163 days aboard the ISS. Soyuz TMA-19 carrying the trio of Yurchikhin, Wheelock and Walker undocked from the space station at 01:23:13 UTC[11]After a nominal descent, the Soyuz TMA-19 descent module landed on the central steppes of Kazakhstan at 04:46 UTC[12][13]After the successful landing, Yurchikhin headed forStar City– the home of theYuri Gagarin Cosmonaut Training CenterinRussia.[14]

Expedition 36/37
Yurchikhin served as Soyuz commander aboardSoyuz TMA-09Mwhich launched to the ISS on 28 May 2013, docking some six hours later, with fellow crewmembers NASA astronautKaren Nybergand ESA astronautLuca Parmitano. He served as flight engineer forExpedition 36, and as ISS commander forExpedition 37. For a short time Yurchikhin was commander to a crew of nine, after the docking ofSoyuz TMA-11Mon 7 November 2013, with four astronaut corps represented between the nine crewmembers (Roscosmos,NASA,ESA,JAXA).
The three returned to Earth aboard their Soyuz on 11 November 2013.

Expedition 51/52
Yurchikhin launched aboardSoyuz MS-04for his fifth spaceflight to the ISS on 20 April 2017, with his crew memberJack D. Fischer. Soyuz MS-04 was the first of the Soyuz-MS series to rendezvous and dock with the ISS using the 6 hours profile, as opposed to the previous 2 days rendezvous procedure. He served as a flight engineer forExpedition 51, and on 1 June 2017, assumed command of the ISS over from crewmemberPeggy Whitson.[15][16]
Yurchikhin handed over the station command toRandy Bresnikon 2 September 2017,[17]and returned to Earth along withPeggy WhitsonandJack D. FischeraboardSoyuz MS-04on 3 September 2017.[18]The overall duration of his stay in space during Expedition 51/52 was 135 days, 18 hours and 8 minutes.[19]
After Expedition 51/52, Yurchikhin cumulative duration in space is 672 days 20 hours and 38 minutes.[19]

Spacewalk summary
On 30 May 2007, at 19:05 UTC, Yurchikhin began his first spacewalk from thePirsdocking compartmentairlock. He and fellow cosmonautOleg Kotovperformed a five-hour and 25 minutespacewalk, during which they installed protective panels to shield ISS from space debris.[20]
On 6 June 2007, Yurchikhin performed his second spacewalk from thePirsdocking compartment airlock. The two spacewalkers installed a section of Ethernet cable on theZaryamodule, installed additional Service Module Debris Protection (SMDP) panels onZvezda, and deployed a Russian scientific experiment. Yurchikhin and Kotov returned to the ISS at 20:00 UTC to wound up the five hours, 37 minutes spacewalk.[21]
On 23 July 2007, Yurchikhin participated in his third spacewalk along with NASA astronautClayton Anderson. He emerged from the U.S.Questairlock at 10:24 UTC, to officially begin the spacewalk.[22]During the spacewalk, Yurchikhin and Anderson removed and jettisoned the Early Ammonia Servicer (EAS), installed a television camera stanchion, reconfigured a power supply for an antenna assembly, and performed several get-ahead tasks. The spacewalk lasted seven hours and 41 minutes.
On 26 July 2010, Yurchikhin and fellow Russian cosmonautMikhail Kornienkoperformed a spacewalk outside the space station. The two cosmonauts on 23 July 2010 put on theirOrlan space suitsand performed a dry run of thespacewalkactivities. From inside the Pirs docking compartment they checked out the Orlan systems, practiced translation movements and tested their mobility. During the spacewalk (Russian EVA #25), Yurchikhin and Kornienko outfitted the Rassvet module's (MRM-1) Kurs automated rendezvous system, installed cables and remove and replaced a video camera.[23]The spacewalk lasted six hours and 42 minutes.
On 15 November 2010, Yurchikhin participated in a spacewalk with cosmonaut andExpedition 25flight engineerOleg Skripochka.[24][25]At 13:25 UTC, he and Skripochka ventured into space outside the ISS from the Pirs airlock to conduct Russian EVA #26. The spacewalk lasted six hours and 27 minutes.[26]It was the fifth for Yurchikhin, who was in the spacesuit marked with red stripes.[27]The two cosmonauts removed Kontur and Expose-R scientific experiments. The Kontur experiment studied remote object control capability for robotic arms and the Expose-R experiment is aEuropean Space Agencyexperiment designed to expose organic material to the extreme environment of space. During the spacewalk, Yurchikhin and Skripochka also installed a portable multipurpose workstation on the Zvezda service module and installed handrail extensions between the Poisk module and both Zvezda and Zarya modules. They performed an experiment called Test, which is aimed at verifying the existence ofmicroorganismsor contamination underneath insulation on the Russian segment of the ISS. Yurchikhin and Skripochka removed a television camera from theRassvet module, however they were not able to relocate the camera due to interference with insulation where it was to be installed.[28]
On 24 June 2013, Yurchikhin performed a spacewalk with cosmonautAlexander Misurkin. The two spacewalkers exited the Space Station's Pirs docking compartment with the primary goal of preparing for the addition of a new Russian module.[29]The Orlan-MK space suits of Yurchikhin and Misurkin were equipped with NASA helmet cameras to provide close-up views of their work. During the spacewalk, Yurchikhin and Misurkin replaced a fluid flow control panel on the Zarya module. They also installed clamps for future power cables as an early step toward swapping the Pirs airlock with the newNauka moduleplanned to launch in 2021. The two cosmonauts also retrieved two science experiments and installed one new one. The spacewalk lasted six hours and 34 minutes.
On 16 August 2013, Yurchikhin performed his seventh spacewalk with cosmonaut Alexander Misurkin.[30]They first set up a Strela cargo boom on the Poisk module. Misurkin used theStrela boomto maneuver Yurchikhin with cables and Yurchikhin rerouted a cable connector and installed cables on theZaryamodule. The cable work outside the station was to prepare the ISS for the planned arrival of the Multipurpose Laboratory Module (MLM) –Nauka. The spacewalk ended at seven hours, 29 minutes when the cosmonauts closed the Pirs docking compartment hatch and re-entered the space station. The spacewalk set a new Russian spacewalk record, eclipsing the old mark of seven hours and 16 minutes set by two cosmonauts outside the Mir space station in July 1990. However, the record held by Yurchikhin and Misurkin was soon eclipsed by cosmonautsOleg KotovandSergey Ryazanskywhen they performed an eight hours, seven minutes spacewalk on 27 December 2013.
On 22 August 2013, Yurchikhin performed his eight spacewalk with cosmonaut Alexander Misurkin. The cosmonauts exited the Pirs docking compartment and moved out to the first worksite on the Zvezda service module. Yurchikhin and Misurkin removed an External Onboard Laser Communications System, installed on the Zvezda module during an earlier spacewalk in August 2011. Next the spacewalkers successfully installed a camera platform on the starboard side of Zvezda module. Initially, Russian mission controllers advised Yurchikhin and Misurkin to stand down on the installation operations, due to a misaligned base plate issue in the camera platform. However, upon discovering that the problem could be fixed after its installation, the mission controllers gave the go ahead for the installation.[31]Misurkin and Yurchikhin also headed to various sites on the Zvezda module to inspect the antenna covers and tighten screws on six antennas used for providing navigation data duringATV cargo shiprendezvous and docking operations. Yurchikhin also completed the installation of some devices calledgap spannersused to help spacewalkers in their movements between the space station modules. The spacewalk lasted five hours and 58 minutes.
On 17 August 2017, Yurchikhin performed his ninth spacewalk with cosmonautSergey Ryazansky. The cosmonauts tested a new version of theOrlan space suit, deploying fivenanosatellitesand installing external experiments. Spacewalk lasted of 7 hours, 34 minutes.[1]
Yurchikhin is currently seventh on thelist of cumulative spacewalk records, with 59 hours, 28 minutes during his 9 spacewalks.[1]
