Sergei Vasilyevich Avdeyev(Сергей Васильевич Авдеев; born 1 January 1956) is a former Russianengineerandcosmonaut.
Avdeyev was born inChapayevsk,Samara Oblast(formerly Kuybyshev Oblast),Russian SFSR. He graduated fromMoscow Engineering Physics Institutein 1979 as anengineer-physicist[1]. From 1979 to 1987 he worked as an engineer forNPO Energiya. He was selected as a cosmonaut as part of theEnergiaEngineer Group 9 on 26 March 1987. His basic cosmonaut training was from December 1987 through to July 1989. He retired as a cosmonaut on 14 February 2003.
Avdeyev at one point held the record for cumulative time spent in space with 747.59 days in Earth orbit, accumulated through three tours of duty aboard theMirSpace Station. He has orbited the Earth 11,968 times traveling about 515,000,000 kilometers. In August 2005, this record was taken by another cosmonaut,Sergei K. Krikalev; it has since been surpassed by other cosmonauts, the current record holder beingOleg Kononenkosince February 2024.
Avdeyev is married with two children. He is anamateur radiooperator, and hiscall signis RV3DW.

Time dilation record
For a long time, Avdeyev held therecordfortime dilationexperienced by a human being.[1][2][3]In his 747 days aboardMir, cumulative across three missions, he went approximately 27,360 km/h and thus aged roughly 0.02 seconds (20milliseconds) slower from an Earthbound person's perspective,[4]which is considerably more than any other human being, exceptSergei Krikalev.[5]This is due to thespecial relativisticeffect oftime dilationand is not properly thought of astime travellingas described by mainstream culture. A common misconception is that theApollo programastronauts hold the record—they did go faster than Avdeyev, but they were only in space for a few days.
