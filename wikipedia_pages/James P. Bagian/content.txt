James Philip Bagian(born February 22, 1952), is an Americanphysician,engineer, and formerNASAastronautofArmeniandescent. During his career as an astronaut, he logged 337 hours of space-flight, over two missions,STS-29(in 1989) andSTS-40(in 1991). After leaving NASA in 1995, Bagian was elected as a member of theInstitute of Medicine. He was also elected as member into theNational Academy of Engineeringin 2000 for the integration of engineering and medical knowledge in applications to aerospace systems, environmental technology, and patient safety.
Bagian is currently the Director of the Center for Healthcare Engineering and Patient Safety at theUniversity of Michigan.
Bagian is the only[1][2]person ofArmeniandescent to have been in space.[3][4][5]

Education
Bagian graduated fromCentral High SchoolinPhiladelphia, Pennsylvania, in 1969; received aBachelor of Sciencedegree inmechanical engineeringfromDrexel Universityin 1973, graduating first in his class, and aDoctor of Medicinedegree fromThomas Jefferson Universityin 1977, where he was a member ofAlpha Omega Alpha.

Experience
Bagian worked as a process engineer for the3MCompany inBristol, Pennsylvania, in 1973, and later as a mechanical engineer at theU.S. NavalAir Test Center atPatuxent River,Maryland, from 1976 to 1978, and at the same time, pursued studies for his medical degree. Upon graduating from Thomas Jefferson University in 1977, Bagian completed one year of general surgery residency with theGeisinger Medical CenterinDanville, Pennsylvania.
He subsequently went to work as aflight surgeonandresearchmedical officer at theLyndon B. Johnson Space Centerin 1978, while concurrently completing studies at theUSAF School of Aerospace MedicineinSan Antonio, Texas, where he graduated first in his flight surgeons class. He was completing a residency inanesthesiologyat theUniversity of Pennsylvaniawhen notified of his selection by NASA for the astronaut candidate program. Bagian received his Professional Engineers Certification in 1986 and was board-certified in aerospace medicine by theAmerican College of Preventive Medicinein 1987.
Since 1981, Bagian has been active in themountain rescuecommunity and has served as a member of theDenali Medical Research ProjectonDenali. He has been a snow-and-ice rescue techniques instructor onMount Hoodduring this period. Bagian is acolonelin theU.S. Air Force Reserveand is the pararescue flight surgeon for the939th Air Rescue Wing. He is a USAF-qualified freefallparachutist, holds a private pilot's license and has logged over 1,500 hours flying time inpropellerandjet aircraft,helicopters, andgliders.

NASA experience
Bagian became a NASA astronaut in July 1980. He took part in both the planning and provision of emergency medical and rescue support for the first sixShuttleflights. He served as the Astronaut Office coordinator for Space Shuttle payload software and crew equipment, as well as supporting the development of a variety ofpayloadsand participating in the verification of Space Shuttle flight software.
In 1986, Bagian served as an investigator for the 51-L accident board. He was responsible for the development program and implementation of the pressure suit used for crew escape and various other crew survival equipment to be used on future Shuttle missions, and is in charge of Shuttle search and rescue planning and implementation for the Astronaut Office. Bagian was a member of the NASA Headquarters Research Animal Holding Facility Review Board.
He has authored numerous scientific papers in the fields of human factors, environmental and aerospace medicine. A veteran of two space flights (STS-29in 1989 andSTS-40in 1991), Bagian has logged over 337 hours in space. In 2003 Bagian served as the Chief Flight Surgeon and Medical Consultant for the Columbia Accident Investigation Board and currently serve as a member of the NASA Aerospace Safety Advisory Panel.

STS-29
Bagian first flew on the crew of STS-29, which launched fromKennedy Space Center,Florida, aboard theOrbiterDiscovery, on March 13, 1989. During this highly successful five-day mission, the crew deployed a Tracking and Data Relay Satellite and performed numerous secondary experiments, including a Space Station "heat pipe" radiator experiment, two student experiments, a protein crystal growth experiment, and a chromosome and plant cell division experiment. Bagian was the principal investigator and performed Detailed Supplementary Objective 470 which described, by the use of transcranial Doppler, the changes of cerebral blood flow and its relationship toSpace Adaptation Syndrome(SAS) andSpace Motion Sickness(SMS).
Bagian was the first person to treat SMS with the drugPhenerganby intramuscular injection.[citation needed]This represented the first successful treatment regimen for SMS and has now been adopted by NASA as the standard of care for the control of SMS in Shuttle crews and is routinely used. In addition, the crew took over 3,000 photographs of the Earth using several types of cameras, including theIMAX70 mm movie camera. Mission duration was 80 orbits and concluded with a landing atEdwards Air Force Base,California, on March 18, 1989. With the completion of this mission, he logged over 119 hours in space.[citation needed]

STS-40
Bagian served as the Lead Mission Specialist on the crew of STS-40SpacelabLife Sciences, the first dedicated space and life sciences mission, which launched from the Kennedy Space Center, Florida, on June 5, 1991. SLS-1 was a nine-day mission during which crew members performed experiments that explored how the heart, blood vessels, lungs, kidneys, and hormone-secreting glands respond to microgravity, the causes of space sickness, and changes in muscles, bones, and cells which occur in humans during space flight.
Other payloads included experiments designed to investigate materials science, plant biology and cosmic radiation. In addition to the scheduled payload activities on STS-40, Bagian was successful in personally devising and implementing repair procedures for malfunctioning experiment hardware which allowed all scheduled scientific objectives to be successfully accomplished.
On this flight, astronaut James Bagian performed was the first magic trick performed in space. Before launch, he secured permission from the STS-40 Flight Director and Director of Flight Operations to perform the first magic trick in space and link it real-time via television to Mission Control. Bagian also left pre-flight instructions with the Mission Control Capsule Communicator (CAPCOM), Marsha Ivins, to purchase a standard deck of playing cards and leave the cards unopened to be used on his instructions when he was on orbit and performing the illusion. Bagian brought a second, identical deck with him aboard the shuttle. He claimed to have chosen one card from his onboard deck of cards and placed it facing the opposite direction before liftoff. During the mission, Mission Control Communicator Marsha Ivins, on live TV, opened the sealed deck, shuffled it, and randomly selected a card. Bagian then revealed his deck, where one card was reversed. Pilot Sidney Gutierrez pulled out the reversed card—revealing it to be the exact same card Marsha had selected on Earth.[6][7]
Following 146 orbits of the Earth,Columbiaand her crew landed at Edwards Air Force Base, California, on June 14, 1991.[citation needed]
Completion of this flight logged him an additional 218 hours in space.[citation needed]

Post-NASA
Bagian left NASA in 1995. He was elected to membership in theNational Academy of Engineeringand the Institute of Medicine. Bagian was the Veterans Health Administration (VHA) Chief Patient Safety Officer, and Director of the VA National Center for Patient Safety.[citation needed]
Bagian was the first and founding director of the VA National Center for Patient Safety and as the Department of Veterans Affairs first Chief Patient Safety Officer where he developed numerous patient safety related tools and programs that have been adopted nationally and internationally.
Bagian is currently the Director of theCenter for Healthcare Engineering and Patient Safety at the University of Michiganand is currently a professor at the University of Michigan with appointments in the Department of Anesthesia and the College of Engineering.
Bagian participated in the 2022Starmus Festivalheld inYerevan,Armeniain September 2022.[8]
