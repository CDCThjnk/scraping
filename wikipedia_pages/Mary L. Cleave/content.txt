Early life
Cleave was born inSouthampton, New York, the daughter of Howard Cleave and Barbara Cleave, both teachers.[2]She grew up inGreat Neck, New York, and had an older sister, Trudy Carter, and a younger one, Barbara "Bobbie" Cleave Bosworth.[3]

Education
In 1965 Cleave graduated fromGreat Neck North High SchoolinGreat Neck, New York. In 1969 she received a bachelor of science degree inBiological SciencesfromColorado State University, and in 1975 a master of science inMicrobial EcologyfromUtah State University. In 1979 she received a doctorate inCivilandEnvironmental Engineeringfrom Utah State University.[4]

Academic career
Cleave held graduate research, researchphycologist, and research engineer assignments in the Ecology Center and theUtah Water Research Laboratoryat Utah State University from September 1971 to June 1980.[5]
Her work included research on the productivity of thealgal componentof cold desert soil crusts in theGreat Basin Desertsouth ofSnowville, Utah; algal removal with intermittent sand filtration and prediction of minimum river flow necessary to maintain certain game fish and the effects of increased salinity and oil shaleleachatesonfreshwater phytoplanktonproductivity.[6]She worked on the development of the Surface Impoundment Assessment document and computer program (FORTRAN) for current and future processing of data from surface impoundments inUtah, and the design and implementation of an algal bioassay center and a workshop forbioassay techniquesfor theIntermountain West.[7]

NASA career
Cleave was selected as an astronaut in May 1980.[2]Her technical assignments included: flight software verification in the Shuttle Avionics Integration Laboratory (SAIL);CAPCOMon fiveSpace Shuttleflights; Malfunctions Procedures Book; Crew Equipment Design. A veteran of two space flights, Cleave logged a total of 10 days, 22 hours, 02 minutes, 24 seconds in space,orbitedtheEarth172 times and travelled 3.94 million miles. She was a mission specialist onSTS-61-B(November 26 to December 3, 1985) andSTS-30(May 4–8, 1989).[8]
Cleave leftJSCin May 1991 to joinNASA'sGoddard Space Flight CenterinGreenbelt, Maryland. She worked in the Laboratory for Hydrospheric Processes as the Project Manager for SeaWiFS (Sea-viewing, Wide-Field-of-view-Sensor), an ocean colour sensor which is monitoring vegetation globally. Cleave served as Associate Administrator, Science Mission Directorate, NASA Headquarters,Washington, D.C.She stepped down from that position in April 2007,[2]and was succeeded by Dr.Alan Stern.

Spaceflight experience
STS-61-BAtlantis(November 26 to December 3, 1985) launched at night from theKennedy Space Center,Florida, and returned to land on Runway 22 atEdwards Air Force Base,California. During the mission, the crew deployed theMORELOS-B, AUSSAT II and SATCOM K-2 communications satellites, conducted two 6-hour spacewalks to demonstrate space station construction techniques with theEASE/ACCESSexperiments, operated the Continuous Flow Electrophoresis (CFES) experiment forMcDonnell Douglasand a Getaway Special (GAS) container for Telesat, Canada, conducted several Mexican Payload Specialist Experiments for theMexican Government, and tested the Orbiter Experiments Digital Autopilot (OEX DAP). This was the heaviest payload weight carried to orbit by the Space Shuttle to date. The mission duration was 165 hours, 4 minutes, 49 seconds.
STS-30onSpace ShuttleAtlantis(May 4–8, 1989) was a four-day mission during which the crew successfully deployed theMagellanVenus-explorationspacecraft, the first U.S. planetary science mission launched since 1978, and the first planetary probe to be deployed from the Shuttle.Magellanarrived atVenusin August 1990 and radar-mapped over 95% of the surface of Venus.Magellanhas been one of NASA's most successful scientific missions providing valuable information about the Venusian atmosphere andmagnetic field. In addition, the crew also worked on secondary payloads involving Indium crystal growth, electrical storm, and Earth observation studies. The mission duration was 96 hours, 57 minutes, 35 seconds.
In early 1990, Cleave was selected as Mission Specialist 3 for theSTS-42mission but withdrew herself for personal reasons shortly after her selection was announced.

Death
Cleave died from a stroke at her home inAnnapolis, Maryland, on November 27, 2023, at the age of 76.[2][10]

On January 18, 2009, as the inaugural speaker in the Heyden Distinguished Lecture Series, Cleave told students and others at Georgetown University about her education and career and showed an original film of her shuttle mission in 1985.
