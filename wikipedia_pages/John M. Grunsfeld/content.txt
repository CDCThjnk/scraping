Grunsfeld studied binarypulsarsand energetic x-ray and gamma ray sources using the NASACompton Gamma Ray Observatory, x-ray astronomy satellites,radio telescopes, and opticaltelescopesincluding the NASAHubble Space Telescope. His current research is in planetary science studying the moon Europa, and other solar system bodies in the search for life beyond Earth.

NASA career
Grunsfeld was selected by NASA in March 1992 as an astronaut candidate and reported to theJohnson Space Centerin August 1992. He completed one year of training and qualified for flight selection as a mission specialist. Grunsfeld was initially detailed to the Astronaut Office Mission Development Branch and was assigned as the lead for portable computers for use in space. Following his first flight, he led a team of engineers and computer programmers tasked with defining and producing the crew displays for command and control of the International Space Station (ISS). As part of this activity, he directed an effort combining the resources of the Mission Control Center (MCC) Display Team and the Space Station Training Facility. The result was the creation of the Common Display Development Facility (CDDF), responsible for the onboard and MCC displays for theInternational Space Station, usingobject-oriented programmingtechniques. Following his second flight, he was assigned as Chief of the Computer Support Branch in the Astronaut Office supportingSpace Shuttleand International Space Station Programs and advanced technology development. Following STS-103, he served as Chief of the Extravehicular Activity Branch in the Astronaut Office. FollowingSTS-109, Grunsfeld served as an instructor in the Extravehicular Activity Branch, and worked on the Orbital Space Plane, exploration concepts, and technologies for use beyond low-Earth orbit in the Advanced Programs Branch. He served asNASA Chief Scientistassigned to NASA Headquarters from 2003 to 2004. In January 2012, he became the associate administrator for the Science Mission Directorate at NASA's headquarters in Washington, replacingEd Weiler.[9]
Grunsfeld has been actively engaged in communicating space science topics to the public through interviews, public lectures, and television appearances. He was interviewed by NASA'sAstrobiology Magazineabout theJames Webb Space Telescope[10]and at the Science with Hubble Space Telescope III conference inVenice, Italy, about carrying out repairs and upgrades on the Hubble Space Telescope.[11]His public lectures includeHugging Hubbleat the Space Telescope Science Institute's May, 2010, Symposium,[12]Big Science Questionsat the 50th anniversary celebration of the Aspen Center for Physics[13]andThe Hubble Storypresented as a special public lecture atOxford University's department of physics.[14]He has made several television appearances to discuss the successful landing of theMarsCuriosityroverin August 2012 and its mission, including appearances on thePBS NewsHourwithJudy Woodruff,[15]theColbert Report,[16][17]and onNASA television.[18]
On April 5, 2016, Grunsfield announced his retirement from NASA, starting April 30.

Spaceflight experience
STS-67/Astro-2Space ShuttleEndeavour(March 2–18, 1995) was launched fromKennedy Space Center,Florida, and returned to land atEdwards Air Force Base,California. It was the second flight of the Astro observatory, a unique complement of three ultra-violet telescopes. During this record-setting 16-day mission, the crew conducted observations around the clock to study the far ultraviolet spectra of faint astronomical objects and the polarization of ultraviolet light coming from hot stars and distant galaxies. Mission duration was 399 hours and 9 minutes.
STS-81Space ShuttleAtlantis(January 12–22, 1997) was a 10-day mission, the fifth to dock with Russia'sMirspace station, and the second to exchange U.S. astronauts. The mission also carried the Spacehab double module providing additional middeck locker space for secondary experiments. In five days of docked operations more than three tons of food, water, experiment equipment and samples were moved back and forth between the two spacecraft. Grunsfeld served as the flight engineer on this flight. Following 160 orbits of the Earth the STS-81 mission concluded with a landing on Kennedy Space Center's Runway 33 ending a 3.9 million mile journey. Mission duration was 244 hours, 56 minutes. During this flight, Grunsfeld placed a phone call toNPR's auto-repair radio show,Car Talk. In this call he complained about the performance of his serial-numbered,Rockwell-manufactured "government van". To wit, it would run very loud and rough for about two minutes, quieter and smoother for another six and a half, and then the engine would stop with a jolt. He went on to state that the brakes of the vehicle, when applied, would glow red-hot, and that the vehicle'sodometerdisplayed "about 60 million miles". This created some consternation for the hosts, until they noticed the audio of Grunsfeld's voice, being relayed from Mir viaTDRSsatellite, sounded similar to that ofTom Hanksin the then-recent filmApollo 13, after which they realized the call was from space and the government van in question was, in fact, theSpace Shuttle.[19]
STS-103Space ShuttleDiscovery(December 19–27, 1999) was an eight-day mission during which the crew successfully installed newgyroscopesand scientific instruments and upgraded systems on theHubble Space Telescope(HST). Enhancing HST scientific capabilities required three spacewalks (EVA). Grunsfeld performed two spacewalks totaling 16 hours and 23 minutes. The STS-103 mission was accomplished in 120 Earth orbits, traveling 3.2 million miles in 191 hours and 11 minutes.
STS-109Space ShuttleColumbia(March 1–12, 2002) was the fourth Hubble Space Telescope (HST) servicing mission. The crew of STS-109 successfully upgraded the Hubble Space Telescope installing a newdigital camera, a cooling system for theinfrared camera, newsolar arraysand a new power system. HST servicing and upgrades were accomplished by four crewmembers during a total of five EVAs in five consecutive days. Grunsfeld served as the payload commander on STS-109 in charge of the space walking activities and the Hubble payload. He also performed three spacewalks totaling 21 hours and 9 minutes, including the installation of the new Power Control Unit. STS-109 orbited the Earth 165 times, and covered 3.9 million miles in over 262 hours.
STS-125Space ShuttleAtlantis(May 11–24, 2009) was the fifth and final servicing mission to the Hubble Space Telescope.Atlantislaunched fromKennedy Space Center Launch Pad 39AMay 11, 2009, at 2:01 p.m. EDT, and landed on May 24, 2009 at California'sEdwards Air Force Base.[20][21]During the mission, Grunsfeld performed three of the mission's five back-to-back spacewalks, which installed two new instruments to the Hubble Space Telescope: TheCosmic Origins Spectrograph, and theWide Field Camera 3. The mission also replaced aFine Guidance Sensor, six newgyroscopes, and twobatteryunit modules, to allow the telescope to continue to function at least through 2014.[22][23]One issue Grunsfeld and his crew experienced during the overhaul was the stripping of 10mm bolts due to improper assembly and technique which he discussed again onCar Talk.
Grunsfeld has logged over 58 days in space, including eight space walks totaling 58 hours and 30 minutes.[24][25]

Space Telescope Science Institute
According to a NASA press release in January 2010, Grunsfeld indicated he would leave the agency to serve as deputy director of the Space Telescope Science Institute in Baltimore.[26]There he helped prepare the institute for operations with NASA's plannedJames Webb Space Telescope.[27]He also became a research professor in the Johns Hopkins University department of physics and astronomy in July, 2010.[28]

Mountaineering
Grunsfeld appeared on thePBSNOVAepisode "Deadly Ascent", which showed him climbingDenali, the highest peak in North America, in June 2000. Grunsfeld, along with Howard Donner, (a consultant to NASA) conducted research into the effects of body temperature at high altitudes by using internal thermometers swallowed in pill form. He was able to climb to an altitude of 18,200 feet before one of the team members had difficulty forcing the team to turn back. Grunsfeld was inspired byEdmund Hillary,Tenzing Norgay, andBrad Washburnin mountaineering.
In June 2004, Grunsfeld returned to Denali while on leave from NASA and successfully led a team of fellow NASA climbers that summitted. He is one of two astronauts to have climbed to the top of Denali.
