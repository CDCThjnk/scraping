Dafydd"David"Rhys Williams[1](born May 16, 1954)[2]is a Canadian physician,public speaker, author and retiredCSA astronaut.[3]Williams was a mission specialist on twoSpace Shuttlemissions. His first spaceflight,STS-90in 1998, was a 16-day mission aboard Space ShuttleColumbiadedicated toneuroscienceresearch. His second flight,STS-118in August 2007, was flown by Space ShuttleEndeavourto theInternational Space Station. During that mission he performed threespacewalks, becoming the third Canadian to perform a spacewalk and setting a Canadian record for total number of spacewalks.[4]These spacewalks combined for a total duration of 17 hours and 47 minutes.[3]
In 1998, Williams became the first non-American to hold a senior management position within NASA, when he held the position of Director of the Space and Life Sciences Directorate at theJohnson Space Centerand Deputy Associate Administrator of the Office of Spaceflight at NASA Headquarters.[3]

Education
Williams earned aBachelor of Sciencein biology fromMcGill Universityin 1976, aMaster of Scienceinphysiology, and aDoctor of Medicineand Master of Surgery from McGill University in 1983. He completed a residency infamily medicineat theUniversity of Ottawain 1985 and obtained fellowship inemergency medicinefrom theRoyal College of Physicians and Surgeons of Canada, following completion of a residency in emergency medicine at theUniversity of Torontoin 1988.[3]

Medical career
Williams received postgraduate training in advanced invertebratephysiologyat theFriday Harbor Laboratoriesof theUniversity of Washington.[3]Subsequently, his interests switched to vertebrateneurophysiologywhen, for his master's thesis, he became involved in basic science research on the role ofadrenalsteroidhormonesin modifying the activity of regions within thecentral nervous systeminvolved in the regulation of sleep-wake cycles. While working in the Neurophysiological Laboratories at the Allan Memorial Institute for Psychiatry, he assisted in clinical studies of slow wave potentials within the central nervous system.[3]
His clinical research in emergency medicine has included studies evaluating the initial training and skill retention ofcardiopulmonary resuscitationskills, patient survival from out-of-hospitalcardiac arrest, the early identification oftraumapatients at high risk, and the efficacy oftetanusimmunization in the elderly.[3]
In 1988, he became an emergency physician with the department of emergency services atSunnybrook Health Science Centreas well as a lecturer with the Department of Surgery at theUniversity of Toronto. He served as a member of the Air Ambulance Utilization Committee with the Ontario Ministry of Health both as an academic emergency physician and later as a representative of community emergency physicians. In addition, he has trained ambulance attendants,paramedics,nurses, residents, and practicing physicians in cardiac and trauma resuscitation as a course director in Advanced Cardiac Life Support (ACLS) with theCanadian Heart and Stroke Foundationand in Advanced Trauma Life Support (ATLS) with theAmerican College of Surgeons.[3]
From 1989 to 1990, he served as an emergency physician with the Emergency Associates ofKitchener-Waterlooand as medical director of the Westmount Urgent Care Clinic. In 1990, he returned to Sunnybrook as medical director of the ACLS program and coordinator of postgraduate training in emergency medicine. Subsequently, he became the Director of the Department of Emergency Services at Sunnybrook Health Science Centre, Assistant Professor of Surgery, University of Toronto, and assistant professor of medicine, University of Toronto.[3]He remains active in life science and space medicine research, both as a Principal Investigator and as a Co-Investigator.
In April 2008, Williams was recruited byMcMaster Universityas a physician-scientist where he was the director for the new McMaster Centre for Medical Robotics atSt. Joseph's Healthcare Hamilton.[5]
On May 18, 2011, Williams became the new president and CEO ofSouthlake Regional Health Centre, theregional hospitalinNewmarket, Ontario, to lead the facility into becoming a full-fledged teaching and research centre. He continued in this role until October 2017 when he left Southlake to work as a healthcare and aerospace consultant.

Astronaut career
Williams was selected by theCanadian Space Agencyin June 1992. He completed basic training, and in May 1993 was appointed manager of the Missions and Space Medicine Group within the astronaut program. His collateral duty assignments have included supervising the implementation of operational space medicine activities within the astronaut program and the coordination of the Canadian Astronaut Program Space Unit Life Simulation (CAPSULS) Project. In February 1994 he participated in a 7-day space mission simulation. During this CAPSULS Project he was the Principal Investigator of a study to evaluate the initial training and retention of resuscitation skills by non-medical astronauts. He was also assigned as one of the crew members and acted as the crew medical officer. He announced his retirement as an astronaut on February 29, 2008, effective from March 1, 2008.[6]

NASA experience
In January 1995, Williams was selected to join the 1995 international class of NASA mission specialist astronaut candidates. He reported to theJohnson Space Centerin March 1995 and completed training and evaluation in May 1996. On completing basic training, he was assigned to work technical issues for the payloads/habitability branch of the astronaut office.
From July 1998 to November 2002, Williams served as Director of the Space and Life Sciences directorate with responsibility for research in both physical and biomedical space sciences at theJohnson Space Center(JSC). With this appointment, he became the first non-American to hold a senior management position within NASA.[3]
Overall crew medical safety was one of his principal concerns, in addition to flight medical operations and JSC occupational andenvironmental health. His programs were directed toward protecting astronauts from the hazards of the space environment, including spaceradiationand microgravity, in addition to maintaining their medical, physical, and psychological well-being while aloft and on return toEarth. His other oversight responsibilities were in the fields oftelemedicine, 3-D tissue culture/regeneration in microgravity, the curatorial management ofextraterrestrial materials, and of qualifying humans for very long space journeys and ensuring their safe return to Earth.
Williams served as anaquanauton the firstNEEMO(NASA Extreme Environment Mission Operations) crew aboard theAquariusunderwater laboratoryin October 2001.[4][7]During this mission, he was thrilled to shake hands underwater with Canadian underwater explorerJoe MacInnis.[8]Williams was originally scheduled to commandNEEMO 7in October 2004, but was replaced by back-up crewmember and fellow CSA astronautRobert Thirskdue to Williams undergoing review of a temporary medical issue.[9][10]In April 2006, Williams commanded theNEEMO 9mission.  During this eighteen-day mission, the six-person crew developedlunar surfaceexploration procedures and telemedical technology applications.[4][11]

STS-90
Williams was on a mission specialist 3 onSTS-90Neurolab(April 17 to May 3, 1998). During the 16-daySpacelabflight, the seven-person crew aboardSpace ShuttleColumbiaserved as both experiment subjects and operators for 26 individual life science experiments focusing on the effects ofmicrogravityon thebrainandnervous system. The STS-90 flight orbited the Earth 256 times, covered 6.3 million miles, and logged Williams over 381 hours in space.[12]

STS-118
Williams was assigned to the crew ofSTS-118(August 8 to 21, 2007), an assembly mission to theInternational Space Station. He completed threespacewalksduring this mission, and set two new records during his final EVA on Saturday, August 18: he is the Canadian with the most spacewalks (3) and Williams ended Saturday's EVA with a total duration of 17 hours, 47 minutes of extravehicular time.[13]He was the second Canadian to lead an EVA and is one of four[14]Canadian astronauts who have performed EVAs.[15]
