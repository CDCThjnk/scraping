Claude Nicollier(born 2 September 1944) is the firstastronautfrom Switzerland. He has flown on fourSpace Shuttlemissions. His firstspaceflight(STS-46) was in 1992, and his final spaceflight (STS-103) was in 1999. He took part in two servicing missions to theHubble Space Telescope(calledSTS-61and STS-103). During his final spaceflight he participated in aspacewalk, becoming the firstEuropean Space Agencyastronaut to do so during a Space Shuttle mission (previous ESA astronauts conducted spacewalks aboardMir, seeList of spacewalks and moonwalks 1965–1999). In 2000 he was assigned to the Astronaut Office Extravehicular Activity Branch, while maintaining a position as Lead ESA Astronaut inHouston. Nicollier retired from ESA in April 2007.
He was appointed full professor of Spatial Technology at theÉcole Polytechnique Fédérale de Lausanneon 28 March 2007.[1]
He was an expert board member ofSwiss Space Systems, until the company's dissolution.[2]

Early life and education
Nicollier was born September 2, 1944. After graduating from theGymnase de la Cité(high school) inLausannein 1962, he studiedphysicsat theUniversity of Lausanneand received aLicentiatedegree in 1970.[3]He then worked as a graduate scientist from 1970 to 1973 at the Institute of Astronomy at the university and at theGeneva Observatory, before obtaining a postDiplomadegree inastrophysicsfrom theUniversity of Genevain 1975. In parallel, he became aSwiss Air Forcepilot in 1966, in theFliegerstaffel 5onHawker Hunterwhere he holds a commission as captain, and has logged 5,600 hours flying time, including 4,000 hours in jet aircraft. Later, in 1988, he graduated as a test pilot from theEmpire Test Pilot's SchoolinBoscombe Down, United Kingdom.[3]
In 2004, he started teaching at theÉcole Polytechnique Fédérale de Lausanne, and became a full professor in March 2007.

Astronaut career
Concurrently with his part-time research activities, he joined the Swiss Air Transport School inZürichand became anairlinepilot in 1974, assigned as aDC-9pilot forSwissair. At the end of 1976, he accepted a Fellowship at theEuropean Space Agency’s (ESA) Space Science Department atNoordwijk, Netherlands, where he worked as a research scientist in various airborneinfrared astronomyprograms. In July 1978, he was selected by ESA as a member of the first group of European astronauts. Under agreement between ESA and NASA, he joinedNASA Astronaut Group 9selected in May 1980 for astronaut training as a mission specialist.[3]Unlike colleagueWubbo Ockels—who withdrew from training to focus onSpacelaband remained an ESApayload specialist—Nicollier became a mission specialist, the first non-American to become a full-time NASA astronaut.[4]
Nicollier's technical assignments in the Astronaut Office have included flight software verification in theShuttle Avionics Integration Laboratory(SAIL), participation in the development of retrieval techniques for theTethered Satellite System(TSS),Remote Manipulator System(RMS), andInternational Space Station(ISS) robotics support. From the spring of 1996 to the end of 1998, he was head of the Astronaut Office Robotics Branch. From the year 2000 on, he was assigned to the Astronaut Office EVA (Extravehicular Activity) Branch, while maintaining a position as Lead ESA astronaut in Houston. Nicollier retired from ESA in April 2007.[3]
He is a member of the Swiss Astronomical Society, the Astronomical Society of the Pacific, the Swiss Air Force Officers Society (AVIA), and the Swiss Academy of Engineering Sciences and fellow of the British Interplanetary Society. He is also an honorary member of the Swiss Aero Club, the Swiss Society of Engineers and Architects, and theSwiss Astronomy Day Society.
Nicollier has spent over 1000 hours in space (42 days, 12 hours and 5 minutes), including one space walk lasting 8 hours and 10 minutes. He served as mission specialist on four missions with four different space shuttles.

STS-61-K
His first spaceflight was planned to beSTS-61-K, which had been scheduled for October 1986, but was cancelled following theSpace ShuttleChallengerdisaster.[5]

STS-46
Nicollier's first spaceflight was as a mission specialist on the 8-day Space Shuttle mission aboardAtlantis, calledSTS-46, in 1992. The crew deployed the European Retrievable CarrierEURECA, as well as theTethered Satellite System-1, which was a joint NASA andItalian Space Agencyproject.[6]

STS-61
His second spaceflight was as a mission specialist on the 10-day mission aboardEndeavour, calledSTS-61, in 1993. It was thefirst missionto perform maintenance on theHubble Space Telescope, which had been launched three years previously. The nature of this repair was to correct a 2 micrometer error in the 2.4 meter diameter primary mirror, which caused significant distortion of the images taken by the telescope.[7]

STS-75
In 1996 he took part inSTS-75, aboard Space ShuttleColumbia, which deployedTSS-1R, which was a follow-up mission to TSS-1 which had been deployed during STS-46.[8]

STS-103
His final spaceflight was an eight-day mission aboard Space ShuttleDiscovery, calledSTS-103, in 1999. It was thethird servicing missionto the Hubble Space Telescope. During this mission Nicollier participated in an 8-hourspacewalk; it was his first, and the first of any ESA astronaut during a Space Shuttle mission.[9]
Following his astronaut career, he delivered a lecture on his experiences, “Revisiting Hubble,” at the firstStarmus Festivalin 2011 in the Canary Islands. The talk was published in the bookStarmus: 50 Years of Man in Space.[10]
