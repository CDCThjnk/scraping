Jean-Jacques Favier(French pronunciation:[ʒɑ̃ʒakfavje]; 13 April 1949 – 19 March 2023) was a German-born French engineer and aCNESastronautwho flew aboard theSTS-78NASASpace Shuttle mission in 1996. Favier was due to fly aboard the doomedColumbiamission in 2003 (STS-107), but later opted out of the mission.[citation needed]Jean-Jacques Favier was deputy director for space technology and deputy director for advanced concepts and strategy at CNES, director of the Solidification Laboratory at theFrench Atomic Energy Commissionand research program director at theInternational Space University.[1]

Career
Favier was the advisor to the director of the Material Science Research Center (CEREM) at theFrench Atomic Energy Commission(CEA) and was detached to CNES. He proposed the MEPHISTO program, a collaborative project between theFrench Space Agencyand NASA, and has developed many other scientific projects in collaboration with the United States since 1985. He was the principal investigator for a MEPHISTO materials processing experiment, which made its debut on the United States Microgravity Payload in 1992 and 1994. He became a CNESpayload specialistin 1985. He has been principal investigator of more than ten space experiments in collaboration with ESA, NASA, and the Russian Space Agency.
Favier was assigned as an alternate payload specialist onSTS-65/IML-2, the second International Microgravity Laboratory mission, and supported the mission as a Crew Interface Coordinator (CIC/APS) from the Payload Operations Control Center (POCC) at theMarshall Space Flight CenterinHuntsville, Alabama.
Favier flew onSTS-78and logged over 405 hours in space. STS-78Columbia(20 June to 7 July 1996) was a 16-day Life and MicrogravitySpacelabmission. It included studies sponsored by ten nations and five space agencies, was the first mission to combine both a full microgravity studies agenda and a comprehensive life science investigation, and served as a model for future studies on board theInternational Space Station. STS-78 orbited the Earth 271 times, covering 7 million miles in 405 hours, 48 minutes.
Favier was a member of the board of advisors of theInternational Space Universityand also the chair of the research steering committee.[1]He was co-founder of a remote imaging company called "Blue Planet", aimed at building a constellation of micro-satellites which image with a 1-meter resolution.[2]

Personal life and death
Born inKehl, Germany, he married Michèle Jean. They had four children. He enjoyed skiing, tennis, wind-surfing, and archaeology.[citation needed]
Favier died on 19 March 2023, inAlbiat the age of 73.[3][4]
