Jerry Lynn Ross(born January 20, 1948,Crown Point, Indiana) is a retiredUnited States Air Forceofficer,engineer, and a formerNASAastronaut. Ross is a veteran of sevenSpace Shuttlemissions, making him the joint record holder for most spaceflights (a record he shares withFranklin Chang-Díaz).
His papers, photographs, and many personal items are in the Barron Hilton Flight and Space Exploration Archives at Purdue University. He was inducted into the Astronaut Hall of Fame during ceremonies in May 2014.
Ross is the author ofSpacewalker: My Journey in Space and Faith as NASA's Record-Setting Frequent Flyer(Purdue University Press, 2013) with John Norberg. In March 2014, it was announcedSpacewalkerwould be available in a French translation through the specialist aerospace publisher, Altipresse.
Fellow astronaut,Chris Hadfield, describes Ross in his 2013 autobiography,An Astronaut's Guide to Life on Earth, as "the embodiment of the trustworthy, loyal, courteous and brave astronaut archetype."[2]

Education
Ross graduated fromCrown Point High School,Crown Point, Indiana, in 1966. He received aBachelor of Sciencein 1970 and aMaster of Sciencedegree in 1972, both inMechanical EngineeringfromPurdue University. At Purdue, he joined thePurdue Reamer Club.[3]

Military career
Ross, an Air ForceROTCstudent at Purdue University, received his commission upon graduation in 1970. After receiving his master's degree from Purdue in 1972, he entered active duty with the Air Force and was assigned to the Ramjet Engine Division of Air Force Aero-Propulsion Laboratory atWright-Patterson Air Force Base, in Ohio. He conducted computer-aided design studies onramjetpropulsion systems, served as the project engineer forcaptive testsof a supersonic ramjet missile using a rocket sled track, and as the project manager for preliminary configuration development of theASALMstrategic air-launched missile.
From June 1974 to July 1975, he was theLaboratory Executive Officerand Chief of theManagement Operations Office. Ross graduated from theUSAF Test Pilot School’s Flight Test Engineer Course in 1976 and subsequently was assigned to the6510th Test WingatEdwards Air Force Base, California. While on assignment to the 6510th’s Flight Test Engineering Directorate, he was project engineer on a limited flying qualities evaluation of theRC-135Saircraft, and, as leadB-1flying qualities flight test engineer, was responsible for the stability, control, and flight control system testing performance on the B-1 aircraft. As chief B-1 flight test engineer, he was also responsible for training and supervising all Air Force B-1 flight test engineer crew members and for performing the mission planning for the B-1 offensive avionics test aircraft.
Ross has flown in 21 different types of aircraft, holds aprivate pilot's license, and has logged over 3,900 flying hours, the majority in military aircraft. He retired from the Air Force on March 31, 2000.

NASA career
In February 1979, Ross was assigned to thePayload Operations Divisionat theLyndon B. Johnson Space Center, as a payload officer/flight controller who was responsible for the flight operations integration of payloads into theSpace Shuttle. Ross was selected as anastronautin May 1980. His technical assignments since then have includedEVA, or "space walks", RMS (Remote Manipulator System, or "robotic arm"), andchase team; support crewman forSTS 41-B,STS 41-CandSTS 51-A; spacecraft communicator (CAPCOM) duringSTS 41-B,STS 41-C,STS 41-D,STS 51-AandSTS 51-D; Chief of theMission Support Branch; member of the 1990Astronaut Selection Board; Acting Deputy Chief of the Astronaut Office, Chief of the Astronaut Office EVA and Robotics Branch, and Astronaut Office Branch Chief forKennedy Space CenterOperations Support. Ross was assigned toSTS-62-A, the first Shuttle mission to launch fromVandenberg Air Force Base, but the mission was canceled after theSpace ShuttleChallengerdisaster.
Ross flew as amission specialistonSTS 61-B(1985),STS-27(1988) andSTS-37(1991), was thePayload CommanderonSTS-55/Spacelab-D2 (1993), and again served as a mission specialist on the second Space Shuttle to rendezvous and dock with the Russian Space StationMir,STS-74(1995), the firstInternational Space Stationassembly mission,STS-88(1998) andSTS-110(2002). A veteran of 7 space flights, Ross has over 1,393 hours in space, including 57 hours and 55 minutes on 9EVAs.[1](see below)
In addition to his record number of launches, among his many personal milestones, Ross held the U.S. record for spacewalks (9) until that was surpassed by the current record holder,ISSExpedition 14commanderMichael Lopez-Alegria(10 EVA's totaling 67 hours and 40 minutes). However, there is speculation that onSTS-27(1988), Ross made an additional EVA. This shuttle mission was a classifiedDoDsatellite launch and therefore information about the flight has never been released. Ross also holds the record for most flights on a single Space Shuttle orbiter (Atlantis) at five.[4]
In 2013 John Norberg, who worked with Ross on his book, filed a Freedom of Information Act concerning STS-27 with the National Reconnaissance Office. The NRO confirmed it had control of the records and declined to release any information about the flight. Ross has never commented on the objectives or his work on STS-27. Ross officially ranks third in the world for spacewalks behind Russian Anatoly Solovyev (16) and Lopez-Alegria.
Ross served as Chief of the Vehicle Integration Test Office at the Johnson Space Center in Houston, Texas until he retired in January 2012.
Ross retired fromNASAon January 28, 2012, after being the first person to launch into space 7 times. He also leavesNASAafter placing third in the most spacewalks after completing 9 EVA's.[5]

Spaceflight experience
STS-61-BAtlantiswas launched at night from theKennedy Space Center(KSC), Florida, on November 26, 1985. During the mission, the crew deployed theMORELOS-B,AUSSAT-2, andSATCOM Ku-2communications satellites, and operated numerous other experiments. Ross conducted two 6-hour spacewalks to demonstrate Space Station construction techniques with theEASE/ACCESSexperiments. After completing 108 orbits of the Earth in 165 hours, 4 minutes, 49 seconds,Atlantislanded on Runway 22 atEdwards Air Force Base, California, on December 3, 1985.
STS-27Atlantis, was launched from KSC on December 2, 1988. The mission carried aDepartment of Defensepayload, as well as a number of secondary payloads. After 68 orbits of the Earth in 105 hours, 6 minutes, 19 seconds, the mission concluded with a dry lakebed landing on Runway 17 at Edwards Air Force Base, California, on December 6, 1988.  The mission is noteworthy due to the severe damageAtlantissustained to its critical heat-resistant tiles during ascent.
STS-37Atlantis, was launched from KSC on April 5, 1991, and deployed the 35,000 poundCompton Gamma Ray Observatory. Ross performed two spacewalks totaling 10 hours and 49 minutes to manually deploy the stuck Gamma Ray Observatory antenna and to test prototypeSpace Station Freedomhardware. After 93 orbits of the Earth in 143 hours, 32 minutes, 44 seconds, the mission concluded with a landing on Runway 33, at Edwards Air Force Base, on April 11, 1991.
STS-55Columbia, was launched from KSC on April 26, 1993. With Ross serving asPayload Commander/Mission Specialist, nearly 90 experiments were conducted during the German-sponsoredSpacelabD-2 mission to investigatelife sciences,materials science,physics,robotics,astronomy, and the Earth's atmosphere.Columbialanded on May 6, 1993, at Edwards Air Force Base, after 160 orbits of the Earth in 239 hours and 45 minutes.[6]
STS-74Atlantis, launched from KSC on November 12, 1995, was NASA's second Space Shuttle mission to rendezvous and dock with the Russian Space StationMir. During the eight-day flight, t the crew aboard Space Shuttle Atlantis attached a permanentdockingmodule to Mir, conducted a number of secondary experiments, and transferred1+1⁄2tons of supplies and experiment equipment betweenAtlantisand the Mir station.Atlantislanded at Kennedy Space Center on November 20 after accomplishing their achievements in 129 orbits of the Earth, traveling 3.4 million miles in 196 hours, 30 minutes, 44 seconds.[6]
STS-88Endeavour(December 4–15, 1998) was the firstInternational Space Stationassembly mission. During the 12-day mission, the U.S.-builtUnitymodule was mated with the RussianZaryamodule. Ross performed three spacewalks totaling 21 hours 22 minutes to connect umbilicals and attach tools/hardware. The crew also deployed two satellites,Mighty Sat 1andSAC-A. The mission was accomplished in 185 orbits of the Earth in 283 hours and 18 minutes.[6]
STS-110Atlantis(April 8–19, 2002) was the 13th Shuttle mission to visit the International Space Station (ISS). The first mission in the final phase of the ISS Assembly included the delivery and installation of theS0 Truss; the first time the station's robotic arm was used to maneuver space walkers around the station; it was also the first time that all of a shuttle crew's spacewalks were based from the station's,QuestAirlock. Ross performed 2 EVAs totaling 14 hours and 9 minutes. Mission duration was 259 hours and 42 minutes.[6]
