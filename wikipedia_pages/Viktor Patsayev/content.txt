 - Machine translation, likeDeepLorGoogle Translate, is a useful starting point for translations, but translators must revise errors as necessary and confirm that the translation is accurate, rather than simply copy-pasting machine-translated text into the English Wikipedia.
 - Do not translate text that appears unreliable or low-quality. If possible, verify the text with references provided in the foreign-language article.
 - Youmustprovidecopyright attributionin theedit summaryaccompanying your translation by providing aninterlanguage linkto the source of your translation.

Viktor Ivanovich Patsayev(Russian:Виктор Иванович Пацаев; 19 June 1933 – 30 June 1971)[1]was a Sovietcosmonautwho flew on theSoyuz 11mission and was part of the third space crew todie during a space flight. On board the space stationSalyut 1he operated the Orion 1 Space Observatory (seeOrion 1 and Orion 2 Space Observatories); he became the first man to operate a telescope outside the Earth's atmosphere.
After a normalre-entry, the capsule was opened and the crew was found dead.[2]It was discovered that a valve had opened just prior to leaving orbit that had allowed the capsule's atmosphere tovent away into space, suffocating the crew.[3]One of Patsayev's hands was found to be bruised, and he may have been trying to shut the valve manually at the time he lost consciousness.
Patsayev's ashes were interred in theKremlin WallonRed Squarein Moscow.[4]He was posthumously awarded the title ofHero of the Soviet Union, theOrder of Leninand the title ofPilot-Cosmonaut of the USSR. The lunar craterPatsaevand the minor planet1791 Patsayevare named for him.[5]
