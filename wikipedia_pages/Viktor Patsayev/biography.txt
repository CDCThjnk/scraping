- Viktor Ivanovich Patsayev ( Russian : Виктор Иванович Пацаев ; 19 June 1933 – 30 June 1971) was a Soviet cosmonaut who flew on the Soyuz 11 mission and was part of the third space crew to die during a space flight . On board the space station Salyut 1 he operated the Orion 1 Space Observatory (see Orion 1 and Orion 2 Space Observatories ); he became the first man to operate a telescope outside the Earth's atmosphere.
- After a normal re-entry , the capsule was opened and the crew was found dead. It was discovered that a valve had opened just prior to leaving orbit that had allowed the capsule's atmosphere to vent away into space , suffocating the crew. One of Patsayev's hands was found to be bruised, and he may have been trying to shut the valve manually at the time he lost consciousness.
- Patsayev's ashes were interred in the Kremlin Wall on Red Square in Moscow. He was posthumously awarded the title of Hero of the Soviet Union , the Order of Lenin and the title of Pilot-Cosmonaut of the USSR . The lunar crater Patsaev and the minor planet 1791 Patsayev are named for him.
