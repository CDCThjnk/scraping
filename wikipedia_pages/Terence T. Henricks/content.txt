His technical assignments to date include: re-evaluating Shuttle landing sites worldwide; Assistant Manager for Engineering Integration in the Shuttle Program Office; Lead Astronaut of the Shuttle Avionics Integration Laboratory atJohnson Space Center, and of Vehicle Test and Checkout at theKennedy Space Center; Chief of the Astronaut Office Operations Development Branch. He also served as the Assistant for Shuttle to the Chief of the Astronaut Office, directing crew involvement in the development and operation of the Shuttle. A commander of twoSpace Shuttlemissions and pilot of two others, Henricks became the first person to log over 1,000 hours as a Space Shuttle pilot/commander.

Space flight experience
STS-44Atlantislaunched the night of November 24, 1991. The primary mission objective was the deployment of a Defense Support Program (DSP) satellite with an Inertial Upper Stage (IUS) rocket booster. The mission was concluded after 110 orbits of the Earth returning to a landing on the lakebed atEdwards Air Force Base, California, on December 1, 1991.[1][2]
STS-55, the German D-2 Spacelab mission, was launched on April 26, 1993, aboardColumbia, and landed 10 days later on May 6, 1993, at Edwards AFB California. During the ambitious mission 89 experiments were performed in many disciplines such as materials processing, life sciences, robotics, technology, astronomy, and Earth mapping.[1][3]
STS-70launched from theKennedy Space Center, Florida, on July 13, 1995, and returned there July 22, 1995. During 142 orbits of the Earth, the crew performed a variety of experiments in addition to deploying the sixth and final NASA Tracking and Data Relay Satellite. STS-70, with an "all-Ohio" crew, was the first mission controlled from the new combined control center.[1][4]
STS-78launched June 20, 1996 and landed July 7, 1996, becoming the longestSpace Shuttlemission to date (later that year the STS-80 mission broke its record by 19 hours.) The 16-day mission included studies sponsored by 10 nations and five space agencies, and was the first mission to combine both a full microgravity studies agenda and a comprehensive life science investigation. The Life and Microgravity Spacelab mission served as a model for future studies on board theInternational Space Station.[1][5]
