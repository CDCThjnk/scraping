Over his career, Yuri Romanenko spent a total of 430 days 20 hours 21 minutes 30 seconds in space and 18 hours inspace walks.[1]In 1987 he was a resident of theMirspace station, launching onSoyuz TM-2and landing aboardSoyuz TM-3. He remained on Mir for 326 days; that was the longest stay in space at that time.[2]His son,Roman Romanenkois also a cosmonaut, and has become the third second-generation space traveler onSoyuz TMA-15in May 2009.

Early life
Yuri Romanenko was born on August 1, 1944, in Koltubanovskiy village inOrenburg Oblast,Soviet Union. His father was a senior commander on military ships, and mother was acombat medic. His family later moved toKaliningrad, where he graduated from a secondary school in 1961. His hobbies in school included building model aircraft andships,boxing,shootingand underwater fishing. After school, he briefly worked as alocksmithand builder. In 1962 he enrolled at theChernigovHigh Air Force School,Ukraineand graduated with honors in 1966. After graduation, he remained with the School, training the students and practicing as a candidate cosmonaut.[1]He was cleared for space flights in 1970, among only 16 other cosmonauts.[2]

Space missions
His first flight was on December 10, 1977, onSoyuz 26to the space stationSalyut 6. A two-men crew consisted of Romanenko as the flight commander andGeorgi Grechkoas engineer. They spent 96 days and 10 hours on the orbit, meetingSoyuz 27,Soyuz 28andProgress 1. During the mission, Romanenko performed a one and a half hour longspace walk.[1]
In his second mission on September 18, 1980, together with the first Cuban cosmonautArnaldo Tamayo Méndez, Romanenko flewSoyuz 38toSalyut 6and returned 7 days later. With this flight, Méndez was the firsthispanophoneand first person of African descent in space.[3]
The third and last flight of Romanenko was onSoyuz TM-2withAleksandr Laveykinon February 6, 1987, to theMirstation. During that mission, Romanenko spent 326 days aboard Mir, which was the longest stay in space then. He conducted three space walks, on April 11, June 11 and June 16, 1987, with a total duration 8 hr 48 min. He returned to Earth on December 29, 1987, inSoyuz TM-3.[1]
Romanenko retired from flights in 1988 and became the director ofBuran program, which was a Soviet alternative to theSpace Shuttle. The program completed one flight in 1988 and was cancelled in 1993.[2]

Accidents
While working in Salyut 6 station in 1977, Grechko and Romanenko had to perform spacewalks at will to inspect the potential damage at the station, which precluded docking ofSoyuz 25. At some point, they were both in their spacewalk suits in the airlock. Romanenko prepared for a spacewalk and pushed against the wall flying outside, but forgot to attach his safety cord. Grechko managed to grab the cord with one hand, stopping Romanenko. This accident was dramatized in press due to the joke of Grechko who implied Romanenko was on the verge of death.[4][5]However, the electrical cables attaching Romanenko would have certainly stopped him from leaving the space station.[6]
