Johnson (Colonel, USAF, Ret.) was the President and executive director for the Center for the Advancement of Science in Space (CASIS) until March 10, 2018. He is now working with Lockheed Martin.[3]

Background
Johnson was born inSouth Ruislip,Greater London, United Kingdom.[4]He graduated from Park Hills High School (nowFairborn High School),Fairborn, Ohio, in 1980. He is anEagle Scoutin theBoy Scouts of America.[5]He earned aBachelor of Sciencedegree inaeronautical engineeringfrom theUnited States Air Force Academyin 1984, aMaster of Sciencein flight structures engineering fromColumbia Universityin 1985, and aMaster of Business Administrationfrom theUniversity of Texas at Austinin 2005. Johnson is married to the former Cari M. Harbaugh. They have three children, Matthew, Joseph, and Rachel.

Military career
Johnson received his commission from the United States Air Force Academy in May 1984 and attended pilot training atReese Air Force Base, Texas. He was retained as aT-38Ainstructor pilot until 1989, when he was selected for anF-15EEagle assignment. After completing initial F-15E training, Johnson was assigned to the 335th Fighter Squadron, atSeymour Johnson Air Force Base, North Carolina. In December 1990, Johnson deployed toAl Kharj, Saudi Arabia, flying 34 combat missions in support of OperationDesert Storm. In December 1992, he was again deployed to Saudi Arabia for three months, flying an additional 27 combat missions in support ofOperation Southern Watch. In 1993, he was selected for Air Force Test Pilot School atEdwards Air Force Base. After graduation, he was assigned to the 445th Flight Test Squadron at Edwards, where he flew and tested F-15C/E, NF-15B, and T-38A/B aircraft.  He has logged over 5,000 flight hours in more than 50 different aircraft. The story of the name "Box" has been a mystery. During an interview with a group of Executive Management students at the University of Texas, Johnson stated that the origination of the name "Box Johnson" came from his tour in Desert Storm. Johnson incurred a back injury that led him to being sent home early.  He put all of his belongings in a box and then he was taken back to the states. The box was left in the barracks as a reminder to all his fellow soldiers to stare at thinking about how he was at home. So after a while they wrote "Box Johnson" on the box and the name stuck.[3]

NASA career
Selected by NASA in June 1998, he reported for training in August 1998. He completed Astronaut Candidate Training in 2000. Following initial training and evaluation, astronaut candidates receive technical assignments within the Flight Crew Operations Directorate before being assigned to a space flight. In 2000, Johnson was assigned as a Technical Assistant to the Director, Flight Crew Operations Directorate (FCOD). In conjunction with that position, Johnson was assigned to the Shuttle Cockpit Avionics Upgrade (CAU) council – redesigning cockpit displays for future Space Shuttle missions. His design and evaluation work with CAU has continued to the present.
In 2001, Johnson was reassigned from FCOD to the Space Shuttle Branch, where he has held various positions including direct support to the crews ofSTS-100andSTS-108, chief of shuttle abort planning and procedures for contingency scenarios, and ascent procedure development. He also was a key player on several "tiger teams" during the investigation into the cause of the Columbia accident in 2003. Johnson was the astronaut representative to the External Tank (ET) foam impact test team that eventually proved that ET foam debris on ascent could critically damage the shuttle's leading edge thermal protection system. In 2004, Johnson was designated as the Deputy Chief of the Astronaut Safety Branch, focusing on all aspects of Space Shuttle, ISS, and T-38 safety, with special emphasis on improving specific operational procedures and techniques to make astronauts safer in all three vehicles. In 2005, Johnson was appointed as a crew representative supporting the design and testing of NASA's newest spacecraft, the Crew Exploration Vehicle. Johnson was the pilot onSTS-123which launched on March 11, 2008. Johnson was picked to be the mission's primary robotic arm operator.[6][7]
He retired from the Air Force on February 1, 2009, and continued to serve NASA as a civilian.
Johnson was the pilot ofSTS-134, the final flight ofSpace ShuttleEndeavourand the penultimate flight of theSpace Shuttle Program.

Thorne Top Fox Safety Award, the 2005 Dean's Award for Academic Excellence,McCombs School of Business,NASA Superior Performance Award, and the 1996 Lieutenant General Bobby Bond Award for the top Air Force test pilot.
