Andriyan Grigoryevich Nikolayev(ChuvashandRussian:Андриян Григорьевич
Николаев; 5 September 1929 – 3 July 2004) was aSovietcosmonaut. In 1962, aboardVostok 3, he became the third Soviet cosmonaut to fly into space. Nikolayev was an ethnicChuvash[1]and because of it considered the firstTurkiccosmonaut.[2]

Early life
Andrian Grigoryevich Nikolayev was born on 5 September 1929, inShorshely, a village in theChuvashregion of theVolga Rivervalley, and spent his time growing up on a collective farm.[3]

Education and career
Nikolayev supported his family following the death of his father in 1944, however this was not preferred by his mother, who preferred that he earn an education. Nikolayev later entered medical school before he joined the Soviet army.[3]During his training Nikolayev was able to maintain a very calm state during stressful situations. Nikolayev's calm made him a fair candidate for becoming a cosmonaut. His future colleaguesYuri Gagarin,Gherman Titov, and seventeen others joined him in March 1960. Nikolayev's future wife was cosmonautValentina Tereshkova, and he reportedly kissed her goodbye before boarding Vostok 3.[3]

History
Nikolayev flew on twospace flights:Vostok 3(becoming the third Soviet cosmonaut) andSoyuz 9. His call sign in these flights wasFalcon(Russian:Со́кол). On both, he set new endurance records for the longest time a human being had remained in orbit. He also served as backup for theVostok 2andSoyuz 8missions. On 22 January 1969, Nikolayev survived anassassination attempt on Leonid Brezhnev, undertaken by a Soviet Army deserter,Viktor Ilyin. He left the cosmonaut corps on 26 January 1982.
Nikolayev was also the first person to make a television broadcast from space, in August 1962. Vostok 3 was part the first dual space flight, withPavel PopovichonVostok 4.
In the early days of space travel, it was usual to place trainee astronauts into isolation chambers to see how long they could last alone. They sat in silence unable to gauge time. Many men cracked but Nikolayev lasted the longest – four days – and became known as the Iron Man.
On 3 November 1963, he marriedValentina Tereshkova, the first woman to fly in space (seeVostok 6). They had one daughter,Elena Andriyanovna(now a doctor of medicine), before their marriage collapsed. However, it was not until 1982 that they divorced.
In 2004, Nikolayev died of aheart attackinCheboksary, the capital ofChuvashiain Russia. A scandal ensued. His daughter, who lives in Moscow, desired that he be interred in the cemetery atStar City. ThePresident of Chuvashiahad other ideas. After a farewell ceremony in Cheboksary, Nikolayev was buried in his native village of Shorshely. He has no family living in the republic. Plans are in the works to move the body to Star City.
Nikolayev was also a keen skier:
Service in the Air Force made us strong, both physically and morally. All of us cosmonauts took up sports and PT seriously when we served in the Air Force. I know thatYuri Gagarinwas fond ofice hockey. He liked to play goal keeper.Gherman Titovwas agymnasticsenthusiast, Andriyan Nikolayev likedskiing,Pavel Popovichwent in for weight lifting. I don't think I am wrong when I say that sports became a fixture in the life of the cosmonauts.[4]
