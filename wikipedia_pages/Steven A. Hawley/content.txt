Steven Alan Hawley(born December 12, 1951) is a retired astronomer andNASAastronaut who flew on five U.S.Space Shuttleflights. Hawley is aprofessor emeritusof physics and astronomy at theUniversity of Kansas.[1]

Early life
Hawley was born December 12, 1951, inOttawa, Kansas, to Dr. and Mrs. Bernard Hawley. One of Hawley's brothers,John F. Hawley, was atheoretical astrophysicistat theUniversity of Virginia[2]and shared theShaw Prize in Astronomyin 2013.[3]
Hawley graduated fromSalina High School Central,Salina, Kansas, in 1969; he regards Salina as his home town. Hawley attended theUniversity of Kansas, graduating with highest distinction in 1973 withBachelor of Sciencedegrees inPhysicsand inAstronomy. He spent three summers employed as a research assistant: 1972 at the U.S.Naval ObservatoryinWashington, D.C., and 1973 and 1974 at theNational Radio Astronomy ObservatoryinGreen Bank, West Virginia. He attended graduate school atLick Observatory,University of California, Santa Cruz, principal advisor wasWilliam L. Burkegraduating in 1977 with aDoctoratein Astronomy andAstrophysics.

Career
Prior to his selection by NASA in 1978, Hawley was a post-doctoral research associate atCerro Tololo Inter-American ObservatoryinLa Serena, Chile. His research involvedspectrophotometryof gaseousnebulaeandemission-linegalaxies, with particular emphasis on chemical abundance determinations for these objects. The results of his research have been published in major astronomical journals.
Hawley is Professor Emeritus of Physics and Astronomy at theUniversity of Kansas.[1]He also served as director of engineering physics.[4]

Space-flight experience
Hawley logged a total of 32 days, 2 hours, 41 minutes in five space flights.[5]He served as amission specialistonSTS-41Din 1984,STS-61Cin 1986,STS-31in 1990,STS-82in 1997 andSTS-93in 1999. Hawley was the last member ofNASA Astronaut Group 8to make a space flight.[6]He is also the only astronaut to deploy the Hubble Space Telescope (HST) and later fly on one of its servicing missions (STS-31 and STS-82, respectively).[7]

STS-41-DDiscovery
STS-41-DDiscovery(August 30 to September 5, 1984) was launched from theKennedy Space Center,Florida, on its maiden flight and landed atEdwards Air Force Base,California. During the seven-day mission, the crew successfully activated the OAST-1 solar cell wing experiment, deployed the SBS-D, SYNCOM IV-2, and TELSTAR 3-C satellites, operated the CFES-III experiment, the student crystal growth experiment, as well as photography experiments using theIMAXmotion picture camera. The mission was completed in 96 orbits of theEarthin 144 hours and 57 minutes.
Following an aborted attempt to launchSTS-41-Dwhere two main engines were stopped shortly after they started because the third failed to start, Hawley is reported to have broken the tense atmosphere in the shuttle cabin, saying, "Gee, I thought we'd be a lot higher atMECO!"[7]

STS-61-CColumbia
STS-61-CColumbia(January 12–18, 1986) was launched from the Kennedy Space Center, Florida, and returned to a night landing at Edwards Air Force Base, California. During the six-day flight, the crew deployed the SATCOM K1 satellite and conducted experiments in astrophysics and materials processing. Mission duration was 146 hours and 03 minutes.

STS-31Discovery
STS-31Discovery(April 24–29, 1990) was launched from the Kennedy Space Center in Florida, and also returned to land at Edwards Air Force Base, California. During the five-day mission, the crew deployed theHubble Space Telescope, and conducted a variety of middeck experiments involving the study of protein crystal growth, polymer membrane processing, and the effects of weightlessness and magnetic fields on an ion arc. They also operated a variety of cameras, including both the IMAX in-cabin and cargo bay cameras, for Earth observations from their record-setting altitude of 380 miles. The mission was completed in 76 orbits of the earth in 121 hours.

STS-82Discovery
STS-82Discovery(February 11–21, 1997), the secondHubble Space Telescope(HST) maintenance mission, was launched at night and returned to a night landing at Kennedy Space Center, Florida. During the flight, Hawley's primary role was to operate the Shuttle's 50-foot robot arm to retrieve and redeploy the HST following completion of upgrades and repairs. Hawley also operated the robot arm during five spacewalks in which two teams installed two new spectrometers and eight replacement instruments. They also replaced insulation patches over three compartments containing key data-processing, electronics and scientific-instrument telemetry packages. HST was then redeployed and boosted to a higher orbit. The flight was completed in 149 orbits covering 3.8 million miles in 9 days, 23 hours, 37 minutes.

STS-93Columbia
STS-93Columbia(July 22–27, 1999) was launched at night from the Kennedy Space Center on a five-day mission returning to KSC for the 12th night landing in the Shuttle Program's history. Hawley served asColumbia's flight engineer. The primary mission objective was the successful deployment of theChandra X-ray Observatory, the third of NASA's Great Observatories after Hubble Space Telescope and theCompton Gamma Ray Observatory. Hawley also served as the primary operator of a second telescope carried in the crew module and used for several days to make broadband ultraviolet observations of a variety of Solar System objects. The mission completed 79 orbits in 4 days, 22 hours, and 50 minutes.

Organizations
Hawley is a member of theAmerican Astronomical Society, theAstronomical Society of the Pacific, theAmerican Institute of Aeronautics and Astronautics,Sigma Pi Sigma, andPhi Beta Kappa. Now retired, he resides inLawrence, Kansas, where his parents also live.

Personal life
Hawley married fellow astronautSally Ridein 1982. The couple divorced in 1987.
Subsequently, he married Eileen M. Keegan ofRedondo Beach, California, a former public-affairs officer at NASA. She was appointed as spokeswoman for then-Kansas GovernorSam Brownbackin 2013.[5]
He enjoysbasketball,softball,golf,running, playingbridge, and umpiring. Hawley appeared on an episode ofHome Improvement, alongside Space Shuttle Commander,Kenneth Bowersox.[8]
