The STS-74 mission was accomplished in 129 orbits of the Earth, traveling 3.4 million miles in 196 hours, 30 minutes, 44 seconds.
STS-83, the Microgravity Science Laboratory (MSL-1) Spacelab mission, was cut short because of problems with one of the Shuttle's three fuel cell power generation units. Mission duration was 95 hours and 12 minutes, traveling 1.5 million miles in 63 orbits of the Earth.

DUI and reckless murder charges
In 2014, Halsell had a blood alcohol level of 0.12 after causing a crash in Palmdale, California, north of Los Angeles, and pleaded no contest to a charge of drunken driving.[2]In December 2014, a Los Angeles County Superior Court judge sentenced him to 60 months of probation, with the conditions that he not drive with alcohol or drugs in his system, and mandatory submission to any drug, alcohol or chemical test.[3]
On June 6, 2016, while on his probation, Halsell was involved in an allegeddriving under the influencecrash inTuscaloosa, Alabama. In the crash, 11- and 13-year-old half-sisters Niomi James and Jayla Parler were killed, and James' father and his girlfriend were injured. Halsell was subsequently charged with reckless murder and first-degree assault. He refused to provide a voluntary blood sample immediately after the crash.[3]He was allegedly intoxicated, and investigators found an empty wine bottle and a packet of sleeping pills in a motel room where he was staying.[3]He tried to steal and make a getaway in the truck of another motorist who had stopped to help.[3]After being booked, he was released on a $150,000 bond.
On September 1, 2016, Halsell was indicted on two counts ofmurderfor the traffic deaths.[4][5]An initial hearing scheduled in June 2017 was delayed when Halsell's lawyers and those from the state were working toward a settlement.[3]Several years later, the trial was set for March 9, 2020,[6]and in January 2020, a judge ruled that prosecutors would not be permitted to tell the jury about Halsell's prior DUI conviction.[7]This trial was postponed due to a death in the lawyer's family[8]and rescheduled to August 3, 2020.[9]
