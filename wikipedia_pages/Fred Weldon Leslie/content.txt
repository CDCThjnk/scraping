Fred Weldon Leslieis an American scientist who flew on the NASASTS-73Space Shuttle mission as apayload specialist.

Background
Leslie was born on 19 December 1951, inAncón, Panama. He is an instrument-ratedcommercial pilotwith more than 900 hours in variousaircraft. Leslie graduated fromIrving High School,Irving, Texas, in 1970, then received aBachelor of Sciencedegree inengineering sciencefromThe University of Texasin 1974, and amaster's degreeandDoctor of Philosophydegrees inmeteorologywith a minor influid mechanicsfrom theUniversity of Oklahomain 1977 and 1979, respectively. Leslie served on theAmerican Institute of Aeronautics and AstronauticsFluid DynamicsTechnical Committee. he is a member of theAmerican Meteorological Society,Tau Beta Pi,Chi Epsilon Pi, and theUnited States Parachute Association. He holds aWorld Recordas a participant in the 200-person freefall formation set in October 1992.[citation needed]

Academic career
After Leslie earned his Ph.D. in 1979, he served as a postdoctoral research associate atPurdue Universitystudying fluidvortexdynamics. In 1980, he worked for theUniversities Space Research Associationas a visiting scientist at theMarshall Space Flight Center(MSFC).

NASA career
Leslie began work for NASA in 1980 as a research scientist in theSpace Science Laboratoryat the Marshall Space Flight Center. Since 1983, he has served as a co-investigator for theGeophysical Fluid Flow Cellexperiment, which examinessphericalrotatingconvectionrelevant to theatmospheresofstarsandplanets. The experiment flew onSpacelab 3and is also a part of the United StatesMicrogravityLaboratory-2 (USML-2) payload. Leslie was a principal investigator for the Fluid Interface and Bubble Experiment, examining the behavior of a rotating free surface aboard NASA'sKC-135aircraft flying low-gravity trajectories. He is an author on 27 journal papers, 45 conference papers, and nine NASA reports involving atmospheric and fluid dynamic phenomena. Leslie also worked in the MSFC NeutralBuoyancySimulator as a suited subject and safetydiversupporting procedure tests for extra-vehicular activity.
In 1987, he was appointed chief of the Fluid Dynamics Branch, where he led a team of over a dozen scientists, overseeing and participating in both laboratory and theoretical research He was also the mission scientist for Spacelab J (STS-47), coordinating more than 40 domestic and Japanese experiments in fluid dynamics,crystalgrowth, andlife scienceduring the 8-day mission.
Leslie is a researcher at the Marshall Space Flight Center. He is a member of the research team analyzing data from the Geophysical Fluid Flow Cell experiment that flew onSTS-73/USML-2.

Spaceflight
Leslie flew as a payload specialist onSTS-73launched on 20 October 1995, and landed at theKennedy Space Centeron 5 November 1995. The 16-day mission aboardSpace Shuttle Columbiafocused onmaterials science,biotechnology,combustion science, andfluid physicscontained within the pressurized Spacelab module.
