In addition, the crew took over 3,000 photographs of the Earth using several types of cameras, including theIMAX70 mm movie camera, during the 119 hours, 39 minutes, 40 second mission.
 - STS-48, from September 12, to September 18, 1991, was a five-day mission during which the crew of theDiscoverydeployed theUpper Atmosphere Research Satellite(UARS) designed to provide scientists with their first complete data set on the upper atmosphere's chemistry, winds, and energy inputs. The crew also conducted numerous secondary experiments ranging from growing protein crystals, to studying how fluids and structures react in weightlessness. Mission duration was 128 hours, 27 minutes; 34 seconds.
