Stephanie Diana Wilson(born September 27, 1966)[1]is an Americanengineerand aNASAastronaut. She flew to space onboard threeSpace Shuttlemissions and is the secondAfrican Americanwoman to go into space afterMae Jemison. As of 2025,[update]her 43 days in space are the second most of any female African American astronaut, having been surpassed byJessica Watkinsin 2022.

Early life and education
Wilson was born inBoston, Massachusettson September 27, 1966. About a year later, her parents, Eugene and Barbara Wilson,[2]decided to move toPittsfield, Massachusetts.[3]Eugene, a native ofNesmith, South Carolina, used his electronics training from his time in the Navy to get himself a degree fromNortheastern Universityand a long career in electrical engineering forRaytheon,Sprague Electric, andLockheed Martin,[2][4]while Barbara, fromTalbot County, Georgia,[5]worked as a production assistant for Lockheed Martin.[2]
After attending Stearns Elementary School, she attended Crosby Junior High School.[6]For a career awareness class in middle school, Wilson was assigned to interview someone in a field that interested her. Since she liked to look up at the sky,[7]she interviewedWilliams CollegeastronomerJay Pasachoff,[6]clarifying her potential career interest in space. In high school, Eugene encouraged Stephanie to go into engineering,[2]so she decided to become an aerospace engineer.
Wilson graduated from Taconic High School, Pittsfield, Massachusetts, in 1984. She attendedHarvard University, receiving aBachelor of Sciencedegree in engineering science in 1988. Wilson earned aMaster of Sciencedegree in aerospace engineering from theUniversity of Texasin 1992.[1]Wilson has returned to Harvard as a member of theHarvard Board of Overseers.[8]She was the Chief Marshal for the 362nd Harvard Commencement on May 30, 2013.[9]

Career

Engineering
Wilson worked for two years for the formerMartin MariettaAstronautics Group in Denver, Colorado. As a Loads and Dynamics engineer for theTitan IVrocket, Wilson was responsible for performing coupled loads analyses for the launch vehicle and payloads during flight events. Wilson left Martin Marietta in 1990 to attend graduate school at the University of Texas. Her research focused on the control and modeling of large, flexible space structures.
Following the completion of her graduate work, Wilson began working for theJet Propulsion LaboratoryinPasadena, California, in 1992. As a member of the Attitude and Articulation Control Subsystem for theGalileo spacecraft, Wilson was responsible for assessing attitude controller performance, science platform pointing accuracy, antenna pointing accuracy, and spin rate accuracy. She worked in the areas of sequence development and testing as well. While at the Jet Propulsion Laboratory, Wilson also supported the Interferometery Technology Program as a member of the Integrated Modeling Team, which was responsible for finite element modeling, controller design, and software development.

NASA
Selected byNASAas an astronaut candidate in April 1996, Wilson reported to theJohnson Space Centerin August 1996. Having completed two years of training and evaluation, she is qualified for flight assignment as a mission specialist. She was initially assigned technical duties in the Astronaut Office Space Station Operations Branch to work with Space Station payload displays and procedures. She then served in the Astronaut OfficeCAPCOMBranch, working in Mission Control as a prime communicator with on-orbit crews. Following her work in Mission Control, Wilson was assigned technical duties in the Astronaut Office Shuttle Operations Branch involving the Space Shuttle Main Engines, External Tank and Solid Rocket Boosters.
Wilson has flown on three shuttle missions. OnSTS-121, Wilson flew aboard as a mission specialist. She also flew on theSTS-120mission that delivered theHarmony connecting moduleto the International Space Station.[10][11][12]In April 2010, Wilson flew as a mission specialist onSTS-131.
On October 18, 2019, Wilson was ground controller atHoustonfor the first all woman spacewalk byChristina KochandJessica Meir.[13]
On December 9, 2020, NASA announced that Stephanie Wilson was among the candidates for theArtemis program, and if selected, she could be both the first woman and the first African-American on the Moon.
On January 31, 2024, NASA announced that Wilson would fly as mission specialist on theSpaceX Crew-9mission to theInternational Space Station.[14]However, when NASA decided to return theBoeing Starlinercapsule on theBoeing Crew Flight Testuncrewed, Wilson was removed from Crew-9, along with commander and fellow astronautZena Cardman, to make room on the return journey for the Starliner astronauts,Barry E. WilmoreandSunita Williams.[15]On September 28, 2024, she made a brief appearance during NASA's coverage of the Crew-9 launch, which was co-hosted by Cardman and NASA communicator Derrol Nail. Cardman had commented during the nearly five-hour broadcast at length on the experience thatNick HagueandRoscosmoscosmonautAleksandr Gorbunovwere going through as they successfully launched fromCape Canaveral Space Force Stationin Florida.[16]

Spaceflight experience
STS-121(July 4–17, 2006), was a return-to-flight test mission and assembly flight to the International Space Station. During the 13-day flight, the crew of Space Shuttle Discovery tested new equipment and procedures that increase the safety of space shuttles, repaired a rail car on the International Space Station and produced never-before-seen, high-resolution images of the Shuttle during and after its July 4 launch. Wilson supported robotic arm operations for vehicle inspection,Multi-Purpose Logistics Moduleinstallation and EVAs and was responsible for transferring more than 28,000 pounds of supplies and equipment to the ISS. The crew also performed maintenance on the space station and delivered a newExpedition 13crew member to the station. The mission was accomplished in 306 hours, 37 minutes, and 54 seconds.
STS-120(October 23 – November 7, 2007) was a 6.25 million mileSpace Shuttlemission to the International Space Station.[17]It delivered theHarmonymodule, and reconfigured theP6truss in preparation for future assembly missions.[18]STS-120 carried a newExpedition 16crew member,Daniel Tani, and returnedExpedition 15and Expedition 16 crewmemberClayton Anderson. The crew conducted fourspacewalksand performed a previously untested repair method on the station's solar array. The mission was accomplished in 15 days, 2 hours, 23 minutes, during 238 orbits.[19]
STS-131(April 5–20, 2010) was a resupply mission to the International Space Station. Space Shuttle Discovery was launched pre-dawn from Kennedy Space Center. Once docked to the space station, the crew delivered more than 27,000 pounds of hardware, supplies, experiments and equipment, including a tank full of ammonia coolant that required three spacewalks and robotics to install, new crew sleeping quarters, a window observation facility and a freezer for experiments.
During the mission, Wilson was responsible for robotics for spacewalking support using the space station robotic arm and for robotic removal of the "Leonardo" Multi-Purpose Logistics Module from the payload bay of Discovery. For the return to Earth, Wilson robotically installed Leonardo, which was packed with more than 6,000 pounds of hardware, science results and used supplies, inside Discovery's payload bay. The STS-131 mission was accomplished in 15 days, 2 hours, 47 minutes, and 10 seconds and traveled 6,232,235 statute miles in 238 orbits.
Artemis(2017–present) is the mission NASA announced in 2020 to return to the Moon.[21]Wilson has been selected as one of eighteen astronauts comprising the Artemis team.[22][23]

Personal life
Wilson is a Christian.[24]She is a member ofAlpha Kappa Alphasorority.[25]Her hobbies include skiing and stamp collecting.[26]She married Julius "BJ" McCurdy, a television producer, in June 1999.[27][28][29][30]The couple divorced in 2003.[31]
