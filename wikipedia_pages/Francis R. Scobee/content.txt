While awaiting his firstorbital spaceflightmission, Scobee served as aninstructor pilotfor the Shuttle's747 carrier aircraft. In April 1984, he pilotedChallengermissionSTS-41-C, which successfully deployed onesatelliteand repaired another.

Early life
Scobee was born May 19, 1939, inCle Elum, Washington, to Francis William Scobee and Edlynn (Miller) Scobee. He attended North Auburn Elementary School (Later named Dick Scobee Elementary after him), Cascade Jr. High School, andAuburn Senior High School, from which he graduated in 1957.[2]

Scobee enlisted in theUnited States Air Forcein 1957, where he served as areciprocating enginemechanicatKelly Air Force BaseinSan Antonio,Texas. While off duty, Scobee attendedSan Antonio College, and eventually received aBachelor of Sciencedegree inAerospace Engineeringfrom theUniversity of Arizonain 1965. He was a member ofTau Beta Pi.
In 1965, Scobee was awarded anofficer'scommission. Afterward, he attended flight school and earned hispilot wingsin 1966, serving as acombataviatorin theVietnam War. Scobee was awarded theDistinguished Flying Cross, theAir Medal, and other decorations.
After his tour of duty, Scobee attended theUSAF Aerospace Research Pilot School(Class 71B) atEdwards Air Force Base, 100 miles north ofLos Angeles,California. Upon graduation in 1972, he became an Air Forcetest pilot, logging thousands of hours of flight time in dozens ofaircraft, including theBoeing 747, the experimentalX-24Blifting body, theF-111 Aardvark, and the giganticC-5 Galaxy.[1]

Challenger
Scobee was assigned commander for the ill-fatedSTS-51-Lmission, after having previously flownChallengerinSTS-41-Cas a pilot. The mission, designed to deploy a satellite to study the approachingHalley's Cometand to inaugurate theTeacher in Space Project, was delayed numerous times due to bad weather and technical glitches. When the mission finally did lift off thepad, a solid rocket boosterO-ringseal failuredestroyed the shuttle73 seconds into the flight, killing Scobee and the other six crew members; the disaster, viewed live on national television, prompted several days of national mourning, as well as a major shakeup at NASA. He died alieutenant colonel. At T+68 into the mission, the CAPCOMRichard Coveyinformed the crew that they were "go at throttle up", and Scobee confirmed the call—his last recorded words were his response, "Roger, go at throttle up." The shuttle broke up at an altitude of 48,000 feet (14.6 km).[3]
Some experts, including one of NASA's lead investigators,Robert Overmyer, who was closest to Scobee, believed most if not all of the crew were alive and possibly conscious during the entire descent until impact with the ocean. After the investigation, Overmyer stated, "I not only flew with Dick Scobee, we owned a plane together, and I know Scob did everything he could to save his crew. Scob fought for any and every edge to survive. He flew that ship without wings all the way down."[4]
