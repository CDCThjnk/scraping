Janice Elaine Voss(October 8, 1956 – February 6, 2012) was an Americanengineerand aNASAastronaut. Voss received herB.S.in engineering science fromPurdue University, herM.S.inelectrical engineeringfromMIT, and herPhDinaeronauticsandastronauticsfromMIT.[1]She flew in space five times, jointly holding the record for American women.[2]Voss died in Arizona on February 6, 2012, frombreast cancer.[3][4][5]

Education
Voss was born in South Bend, Indiana, in 1956 and grew up in Rockford, Illinois, where she received her kindergarten-6th grade education from Maud E. Johnson Elementary School and Guilford Center School.[6]In 1972, Voss graduated from Minnechaug Regional High School in Wilbraham, Massachusetts.[1]After high school, Voss went on to earn herBachelor of Sciencein engineering science fromPurdue Universityin 1975.[7]During her time at Purdue, she was a member ofAlpha Phi Omega.[8]Voss continued her education atMIT, earning herMaster of Sciencedegree inelectrical engineeringin 1977, completing her thesis onKalman filteringtechniques.[7]From 1973 to 1975, Voss took correspondence courses at theUniversity of Oklahoma.[1]From 1977 to 1978, she completed work inspace physicsatRice University.[1]In 1983, Voss became a Draper Fellow while continuing her graduate studies in theDraper LaboratoryatMIT.[7][9]As a Draper Laboratory Fellow, she worked on developing software for the space shuttle program.[10]Voss earned herDoctor of PhilosophyinaeronauticsandastronauticsfromMITin 1987.[7]For her PhD work, Voss focused on developingalgorithmsto identifyfrequencies,damping, and mode shapes for theInternational Space Station.[10]

Inspiration
Voss has cited Madeleine L'Engle's 1962 novelA Wrinkle in Timeas one of her primary inspirations for becoming an astronaut.[11]The book tells the story of a young girl who must travel through time to save her father. In the book, the young girl's mother is aNobel Prizewinning biologist. Voss claims that the powerful female roles did not strike her as unusual, but were the norms she accepted in life.[11]Voss flew a copy ofA Wrinkle in Timeonboard STS-94 and mailed it to Madeleine L'Engle.[11]

Career
Voss first became involved withNASAin 1973 while she was still pursuing her bachelor's degree.[1]She worked as co-op at theNASA Johnson Space Centeruntil she graduated with herB.S.degree in 1975.[1]During her time atJohnson Space Centershe worked onComputer simulationin the Engineering and Development Directorate. She later returned toJohnson Space Centerin 1977, and spent one year working as a crew trainer, teaching entry guidance and navigation.[1]After completing herPhDin 1987 she began working atOrbital Sciences Corporation, where she worked on mission integration and flight operations to support for an upper stage called theTransfer Orbit Stage(TOS).[1]In the Fall of 1992,TOSlaunched the Mars Observer from aTitan rocketand theAdvanced Communications Technology Satellitein September 1993.[1]
In 1990, Voss was selected byNASAas an astronaut candidate, and became anastronautin 1991.[1]She served as amission specialiston missionsSTS-57(1993),STS-63(1995),STS-83(1997),STS-94(1997) andSTS-99(2000).[1][12]During her career as an astronaut, her technical assignments included workingSpacelab/Spacehabissues for the Astronaut Office Mission Development Branch, and robotics issues for the Robotics Branch.[1]She participated in the first shuttlerendezvouswith theMir space stationonSTS-63, which flew around the station testing communications and in-flight maneuvers for later missions, but never actually docked.[13]As anSTS-99crew member on theShuttle Radar Topography Mission, she and her fellow crew members worked continuously in shifts to produce what was at the time the most accurate digitaltopographic mapof theEarth.[3]Voss logged over 49 days in space, traveled 18.8 million miles in 779 Earth orbits, and all of her missions included at least one other woman.[1][14]
From October 2004 to November 2007, she was the Science Director for NASA'sKepler space telescope, a Sun-orbiting satellite designed to find Earth-likeextrasolar planetsin nearby planetary systems. It was launched in March 2009 and operated through October 2018.[15]At the Astronaut Office Station Branch, she served as the Payloads Lead. She also worked forOrbital Sciences Corporationin flight operations support.[1]

Honors and dedication
Voss received several honors in her lifetime:
 - National Science Foundation Fellowship; 1976[1]
 - Howard Hughes Fellowship; 1981[1]
 - Zonta Amelia Earhart Fellowship; 1982[1]
 - Draper Fellow; 1983[10]
 - NASA spaceflight medal; 1993, 1995[1]
TheCygnus CRS Orb-2spacecraft was named SSJanice Vossin her honor.[16]
The VOSS Model is a scaled model of theSolar System, dedicated to Janice Voss, located at Purdue University's Discovery Park in West Lafayette, Indiana.[17]
