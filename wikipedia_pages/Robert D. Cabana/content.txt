Spaceflight experience
STS-41Discoverylaunched on October 6, 1990, from theKennedy Space Center,Florida, and landed atEdwards Air Force Base,California, on October 10, 1990. During 66 orbits of the Earth, the five-man crew successfully deployed theUlyssesspacecraft, starting the interplanetary probe on its four-year journey, viaJupiter, to investigate the polar regions of the Sun; operated the Shuttle Solar Backscatter Ultraviolet instrument (SSBUV) to map atmospheric ozone levels; activated a controlled "fire in space" experiment (the Solid Surface Combustion Experiment, or SSCE); and conducted numerous other middeck experiments involving radiation measurements, polymer membrane production, and microgravity effects on plants.[7]
STS-53Discoverylaunched from the Kennedy Space Center, Florida, on December 2, 1992. The crew of five deployed the classifiedDepartment of Defensepayload DOD-1 and then performed several Military-Man-in-Space and NASA experiments. After completing 115 orbits of the Earth in 175 hours,Discoverylanded at Edwards Air Force Base, California, on December 9, 1992.[8]
STS-65Columbialaunched from the Kennedy Space Center, Florida, on July 8, 1994, returning to Florida on July 23, 1994. The crew conducted the second International Microgravity Laboratory (IML-2) mission utilizing the longSpacelabmodule in the payload bay. The flight consisted of 82 experiments from 15 countries and six space agencies from around the world. During the record-setting 15-day flight, the crew conducted experiments that focused on materials and life sciences research in amicrogravityenvironment paving the way for future operations and cooperation aboard International Space Station. The mission was accomplished in 236 orbits of the Earth in 353 hours and 55 minutes.[9]
STS-88Endeavour(December 4–15, 1998) was the firstInternational Space Stationassembly mission. During the 12-day mission,Unity, the U.S. built node, was attached toZarya, the Russian built Functional Cargo Block (FGB). Two crewmembers performed three spacewalks to connect umbilicals and attach tools/hardware in the assembly and outfitting of the station. Additionally, the crew performed the initial activation and first ingress of the International Space Station preparing it for future assembly missions and full-time occupation. The crew also performed IMAX Cargo Bay Camera (ICBC) operations, and deployed two satellites, Mighty Sat 1 built by the U.S. Air Force'sPhillips Laboratory, and SAC-A, the first successful launch of anArgentinesatellite. The mission was accomplished in 185 orbits of the Earth in 283 hours and 18 minutes.[10]
Cabana has logged over 910 hours in space.
