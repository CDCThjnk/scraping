Daniel Charles Brandenstein(born January 17, 1943) is theExecutive Vice PresidentandChief Operating OfficerofUnited Space Alliance. He is a formerNaval Aviator,test pilotandNASAastronaut, who flew fourSpace Shuttlemissions. He also served asChief of the Astronaut Officefrom 1987 to 1992.

Career

Military
After graduating with aBachelor of Sciencedegree inmathematicsandphysicsfrom theUniversity of Wisconsin–River Falls,[1]and having been a member ofPhi Sigma Kappa, Brandenstein entered active duty with the U.S. Navy in September 1965 and was attached to theNaval Air Training Commandfor flight training. He was designated aNaval AviatoratNaval Air Station Beeville, Texas, in May 1967 and then proceeded to attack squadronVA-128forA-6 Intruderfleet replacement training. From 1968 to 1970, while attached toVA-196flying A-6s, he participated in two combat deployments on board theaircraft carriersUSSConstellationandUSSRangertoSoutheast Asiawhere he flew 192combat missionsin theVietnam War. In subsequent assignments, he was attached toVX-5for the conduct of operational tests of A-6 weapons systems and tactics; and to theNaval Air Test Center, where, upon graduation from theU.S. Naval Test Pilot SchoolatNAS Patuxent River,Maryland, he conducted tests ofelectronic warfaresystems in various Navy aircraft. Brandenstein carried out a nine-month deployment to the Western Pacific and Indian Ocean on board USSRangerwhile attached toVA-145, flying A-6 Intruders during the period March 1975 to September 1977. Before reporting to theJohnson Space CenterinHoustonas an astronaut candidate, he was attached to VA-128 as an A-6flight instructor.

NASA
Selected by NASA in January 1978, Brandenstein became an astronaut in August 1979. He was ascent spacecraft communicator (CAPCOM) and a member of the astronaut support crew forSTS-1(the first flight of the Space Shuttle). He was subsequently assigned to theSTS-2astronaut support crew and was the ascent CAPCOM for the first two Space Shuttle flights. A veteran of fourspace flights—STS-8 (August 30 – September 3, 1983), STS-51-G (June 17–24, 1985), STS-32 (January 9–20, 1990), and STS-49 (May 7–16, 1992) -- Brandenstein has logged over 789 hours in space. Following his second space flight, he served as the Deputy Director of Flight Crew Operations. Between April 1987 and September 1992 Brandenstein served asChief of the Astronaut Office.
He retired from NASA and theUnited States Navyin October 1992.
Brandenstein was a pilot onSTS-8, his first flight, which was launched from theKennedy Space Center,Florida, on August 30, 1983. This was the third flight for the OrbiterChallengerand the first mission with a night launch and night landing. During the mission, crew members deployed the Indian National Satellite (INSAT-1B); operated the Canadian-builtRemote Manipulator System(RMS) with the Payload Flight Test Article (PFTA); operated the Continuous Flow Electrophoresis System (CFES) with live cell samples; conducted medical measurements to understand biophysiological effects on space flight and activated various Earth resources and space science experiments along with four "Getaway Special" canisters. STS-8 completed 98 orbits of the Earth in 145 hours before landing atEdwards Air Force Base,California, on September 3, 1983.[2]
On his second mission (June 17–24, 1985), Brandenstein commanded the crew ofSTS-51-Gaboard the OrbiterDiscovery. During this seven-day mission, crew members deployed communications satellites for Mexico (Morelos), theArab League(Arabsat) and the United States (AT&TTelstar). They used the Remote Manipulator System (RMS) to deploy and later retrieve the SPARTAN satellite, which performed 17 hours ofX-ray astronomyexperiments while separated from the Space Shuttle. In addition, the crew activated the Automated Directional Solidification Furnace (ADSF) and six "Getaway Specials", they also participated in biomedical experiments and conducted a laser tracking experiment as part of theStrategic Defense Initiative. The mission was accomplished in 112 Earth orbits over approximately 170 hours.[3]
Brandenstein then commanded the crew ofSTS-32(January 9–20, 1990). In the longest Shuttle mission to date, crew members aboard the OrbiterColumbiasuccessfully deployed theSyncomIV-F5 satellite, and retrieved the 9,724 kg (21,393 lb)Long Duration Exposure Facility(LDEF) using the RMS. They also conducted a variety of mid-deck experiments, including the Microgravity Disturbance Experiment (MDE) using the Fluids Experiment Apparatus (FEA), Protein Crystal Growth (PCG), American Flight Echocardiograph (AFE), Latitude/Longitude Locator (L3), Mesoscale Lightning Experiment (MLE), Characterization ofNeurosporaCircadian Rhythms (CNCR) and theIMAXcamera. Additionally, numerous medical test objectives, including in-flight Lower Body Negative Pressure (LBNP), in-flight aerobic exercise and muscle performance were conducted to evaluate human adaptation to extended duration missions. Following 173 orbits of the Earth in 261 hours, the mission ended with a night landing in California.[4]
Brandenstein also commanded the crew ofSTS-49(May 7 – 16, 1992), on the maiden flight of the new Space ShuttleEndeavour. During this mission, the crew conducted the initial test flight ofEndeavour, performed a record fourEVAs(space walks) to retrieve, repair and re-deploy the International Telecommunications Satellite (Intelsat) and to demonstrate and evaluate numerous EVA tasks to be used for the assembly of the Space Station'Freedom'. Additionally, a variety of medical, scientific and operational tests were conducted throughout the mission. STS-49 logged 213 hours in space and 141 Earth orbits before landing at Edwards AFB, where the crew conducted the first test of theEndeavour'sdrag chute.[5]

Special honors and awards
