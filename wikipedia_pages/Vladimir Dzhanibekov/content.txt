Vladimir Aleksandrovich Dzhanibekov(Russian:Владимир Александрович Джанибеков, born 13 May 1942) is a retired Soviet Air Force Major General and acosmonautveteran of five orbital missions.

Biography
Dzhanibekov was bornVladimir Aleksandrovich Krysin(Russian:Владимир Александрович Крысин) in the remote area ofIskandarin what was thenBostanliq District,South Kazakhstan Region,Kazakh SSR(since 1956 –Tashkent Region,Uzbekistan)[1]on 13 May 1942. His family moved to Tashkent soon after his birth.
In 1964 he married Liliya Munirovna Dzhanibekova, who was a descendant ofJanibeg, medieval ruler of theGolden Horde. As her father had no sons, Dzhanibekov took his wife's family name in order to honour her ancestry and continue her line of descent, an unusual step for a husband in the Soviet Union.[1]
In 1960 he enteredLeningrad Universityto studyphysics, where he became involved in flying, something in which he had always been interested. In 1961 he decided to enroll in the V. M. Komarov Higher Military Flying School atYeiskwhile simultaneously completing his degree in physics at the Taganrog campus ofRostov State University. Four years later he graduated and became a flying instructor in theSoviet Air Forcesserving at military training unit number 99735 inTaganrogin 1968–1970. During the 1970 visit ofGherman Titovto the Taganrog-based Air Forces training unit he was selected into the cosmonaut training poolAir Force Group 5.[2]He joined theCommunist Partythe same year.
Dzhanibekov served on five space missions:Soyuz 27/Soyuz 26(launch/return),Soyuz 39,Soyuz T-6,Soyuz T-12, andSoyuz T-13. He accrued 145 days, 15 hours, and 56 minutes in space over these five missions. He had also performed twoEVAswith the total time of 8 hours and 35 minutes. In 1985 he demonstrated stable and unstable rotation of a T-handle nut from the orbit, subsequently named theDzhanibekov effect. The effect had been long known from thetennis racket theorem, which says that rotation about an object's intermediateprincipal axisis unstable while infree fall.
In 1985 he was promoted to the rank ofmajor general. After retiring from the cosmonaut program in 1986, he became involved in politics. He was the Deputy to the Supreme Soviet of Uzbek SSR from 1985 until 1990. Also, he has taken up photography and painting, and his works, predominantly of space thematics, are owned by museums and private collectors.
Starting 1990, Dzhanibekov unsuccessfully attempted to circumnavigate the globe byballoon. He partnered withLarry Newmanwho envisioned flying aNASA-designedsky anchorballoon. This unique hourglass shaped design used a zero pressureheliumballoon forbuoyancyand asuperpressure balloonfor variableballast. Manufactured byRaven Industries, the double balloon system together measured 354 feet (108 m) tall.  A proof of concept flight, launched fromTillamook, Oregonon 8 September 1990, was crewed by Dzhanibekov, Newman, Tim Lachenmeier, and Don Moses. Moses replacedRichard Branson, who was unable to make it by the weather window departure time. The flight lasted for continuous 31 hours, spanning two nights, before landing atOmak, Washington, and confirmed the sky anchor balloon nominal performance.[3][4][5]Dzhanibekov,Larry Newman, and Don Moses piloted theEarthwinds Hiltonballoon which was primarily sponsored byBarron Hilton. In 1992 an attempt fromAkron, Ohio did not launch due to strong winds.[6]The next attempt was a planned pre-dawn launch but was delayed for several hours by difficulties inflating both balloons.  Launching later than desired, on 13 January 1993 theEarthwindsliftoff fromReno Stead Airportflew for 30 minutes before crashing. The balloon could not penetrate a strong inversion layer and tore the ballast balloon on a mountain peak. The three crewmen survived the crash without injuries.  An additional flight on 31 December 1994 reached 29,000 feet (8,800 m) when the ballast balloon failed. These sky anchor balloon failures prompted other circumnavigation attempts to switch to theRoziere balloonsystem instead.[7][8]
Theminor planet3170 Dzhanibekov, discovered bySovietastronomerNikolai Stepanovich Chernykhin 1979, is named after him.[9]
