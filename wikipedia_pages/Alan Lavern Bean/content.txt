He received his naval aviator wings in 1956 and served as afighter pilot.

After retiring from theUnited States Navyin 1975 and NASA in 1981, Bean pursued his interest in painting, depicting various space-related scenes and documenting his own experiences in space as well as those of his fellowApollo programastronauts. He was the last living crew member of Apollo 12.

Biography

Early life and education
Bean was born March 15, 1932,[3]inWheeler, the seat ofWheeler Countyin the northeasternTexas Panhandle, to parents Arnold Horace Bean and Frances Caroline Bean (néeMurphy), who lived from 1908 to 1983, and 1906 to 1981, respectively.[4][5][6]He consideredFort Worthhis hometown.[7]He was ofScottishdescent.[8]As a boy, he lived inMinden, the seat ofWebster Parishin northwesternLouisiana, where his father worked for theU.S. Soil Conservation Service.[9][10]Bean was aBoy Scoutand he earned the rank ofFirst Class.[11]He graduated fromR. L. Paschal High SchoolinFort Worth, Texas, in 1949.[12][13]Following his high school graduation in 1949, Bean enlisted in theU.S. Naval Reserve.[14]
Bean received aBachelor of Sciencedegree inaeronautical engineeringfrom theUniversity of Texas at Austinin 1955, where he attended on aNaval Reserve Officers Training Corps(NROTC) scholarship.[14]While at the university, he also joined theDelta Kappa Epsilonfraternity.[15]

Military service
He was an Electronics Technician Striker at theNAS Dallas,Texas, until September 1950, when he washonorably discharged.[13]In January 1955, Bean was commissioned aU.S. Navyensignthrough the NROTC at the University of Texas at Austin, and attended flight training.[12]After completing flight training in June 1956, he was assigned toAttack Squadron 44(VA-44) atNAS Jacksonville,Florida, from 1956 to 1960, flying theF9F CougarandA4D Skyhawk. After a four-year tour of duty,[16]he attended theU.S. Naval Test Pilot School(USNTPS) atNAS Patuxent River,Maryland, where his instructor was his futureApollo 12Commander,Pete Conrad, graduating in November 1960.[7][13]Bean tookartclasses atSt. Mary's College of Marylandduring this tour,[17]and flew as atest piloton several types of naval aircraft. Following his assignment at USNTPS and aviation safety training with theUniversity of Southern California(USC), he went through additional instruction with his old Attack Squadron 44,[13]and was assigned to Navy Attack SquadronVA-172atNAS Cecil Field, Florida, flying theA-4 Skyhawks, during which time he was selected as a NASA astronaut.[14][18]
Bean logged more than 7,145 hours of flying time, including 4,890 hours injet aircraft.[19]

NASA career
Bean was selected by NASA as part ofAstronaut Group 3in 1963 (after not being selected forAstronaut Group 2the previous year).[20]He was selected to be the backup command pilot forGemini 10, but was unsuccessful in securing an early Apollo flight assignment. He was placed in theApollo Applications Programin the interim. In that capacity, he was the first astronaut to dive in theNeutral Buoyancy Simulatorand a champion of the process for astronaut training.[21]When fellow astronautClifton Williamswas killed in an air crash, a space was opened for Bean on the backup crew forApollo 9. Apollo 12 Commander Conrad, who had instructed Bean at the Naval Test Pilot School years before, personally requested Bean to replace Williams.[14][18]
Bean was theApollo Lunar Modulepilot onApollo 12, the second lunar landing. In November 1969, Bean andPete Conradlanded on the Moon'sOcean of Storms—after a flight of 250,000 miles and a launch that included a harrowing lightning strike. He was the astronaut who executedJohn Aaron's "Flight, try SCE to 'Aux'" instruction to restore telemetry after the spacecraft was struck by lightning 36 seconds after launch, thus salvaging the mission. They explored the lunar surface, deployed severallunar surfaceexperiments, and installed the first nuclear power generator station on the Moon to provide the power source.Dick Gordonremained in lunar orbit, photographing landing sites for future missions.[19]
Bean had planned on using a self-timer for hisHasselbladcamera to take a photograph of both Pete Conrad and himself while on the lunar surface near theSurveyor IIIspacecraft. He was hoping to record a good photo, and also to confuse the mission scientists as to how the photo could have been taken. However, neither he nor Conrad could locate the timer in the tool carrier tote bag while at the Surveyor III site, thus lost the opportunity. After finding the self-timer unit at the end of theEVA, when it was too late to use, he threw it as far as he could.[22]His paintings of what this photo would have looked like (titledThe Fabulous Photo We Never Took) and one of his fruitless search for the timer (Our Little Secret) are included in his collection of Apollo paintings.[23][24]
Bean's suit is on display in theNational Air and Space Museum.[25]
Bean was the spacecraft commander ofSkylab 3, the second crewed mission toSkylab, from July 29 to September 25, 1973. With him on the mission were scientist-astronautOwen GarriottandMarine CorpsColonel Jack R. Lousma. Bean and his crew were on Skylab for 59 days, during which time they covered a world-record-setting 24.4 million miles.[19]During the mission, Bean tested a prototype of theManned Maneuvering Unitand performed one spacewalk outside the Skylab. The crew of Skylab 3 accomplished 150% of its mission goals.[19]

Post-NASA career
On his next assignment, Bean was the backup spacecraft commander of the United States flight crew for the joint American-RussianApollo–Soyuz Test Project.[19]
Bean retired from the Navy in October 1975 as acaptain, and continued as head of the Astronaut Candidate Operations and Training Group within the Astronaut Office in a civilian capacity.[19][26]
Bean logged 1,671 hours and 45 minutes in space while atNASA, of which 10 hours and 26 minutes were spent inEVAson the Moon and inEarth orbit.[19]

Painting
Bean resigned from NASA in June 1981 to devote his time topainting. He said his decision was based on that, in his 18 years as an astronaut, he was fortunate enough to visit worlds and see sights no artist's eye, past or present, has ever viewed firsthand and he hoped to express these experiences through his art.[12]
As a painter, Bean wanted to add color to the Moon. "I had to figure out a way to add color to the Moon without ruining it," he remarked. In his paintings, the lunar landscape is not a monotonous gray, but shades of various colors. "If I were a scientist painting the Moon, I would paint it gray. I'm an artist, so I can add colors to the Moon", said Bean.[27]
Bean's paintings includeLunar Grand PrixandRock and Roll on the Ocean of Storms, and he used real Moon dust in his paintings.[28]When he began painting, he realized that keepsake patches from his space suit were dirty with Moon dust. He added tiny pieces of the patches to his paintings, which made them unique. He also used a hammer, used to pound the flagpole into the lunar surface, and a bronzed Moon boot to texture his paintings.[29]
In July 2009, for the 40th anniversary of the Apollo 11 Moon landing, Bean exhibited his lunar paintings at theSmithsonian Institution'sNational Air and Space Museumin Washington.[30]
But I'm the only one who can paint the Moon, because I'm the only one who knows whether that's right or not.
— Bean describing his Moon painting capability[12]

Personal life and death
Bean took a piece ofClan MacBeantartanto the Moon.[31]In recognition of his Scottish ancestry, Bean stated:
As I remember it, I took Clan McBean tartan to the Moon and returned it to Earth. […] I did, in fact, give a piece of the tartan to the Clan McBean and also to the St Bean Chapel in Scotland. And I've still got some of it in my possession. I did not, however leave any of it on the Moon.[32]
He married Sue Ragsdale, a fellow graduate of the University of Texas on April 19, 1955, shortly before her graduation.[33]With Ragsdale, Bean had a son, Clay, and a daughter, Amy Sue.[34][35]
Bean died on May 26, 2018, inHouston, Texas, at the age of 86.[36]His death followed the sudden onset of illness two weeks before while he was inFort Wayne, Indiana.[35]At the time of his death, Bean was married to his second wife, Leslie, and was also survived by his sister, Paula Scott.[35]
Bean was interred inArlington National Cemeteryon November 8, 2018.[37]
