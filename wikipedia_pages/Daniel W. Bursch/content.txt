Daniel Wheeler Bursch(born July 25, 1957[2]) is a formerNASAastronaut, andCaptainof theUnited States Navy. He had fourspaceflights, the first three of which wereSpace Shuttlemissions lasting 10 to 11 days each. His fourth and final spaceflight was a long-duration stay aboard theInternational Space Stationas a crew member ofExpedition 4, which lasted from December 2001 to June 2002. This 196-day mission set a new record for thelongest duration spaceflightfor an American astronaut, a record simultaneously set with his crew mateCarl Walz.[2]Their record has since been broken, and as of 2016 it is held byScott Kelly, who flew a 340-day mission during Expeditions43,44and45.

Education
Bursch graduated fromVestal Senior High School,Vestal, New York, in 1975; received aBachelor of Sciencedegree inPhysicsfrom theUnited States Naval Academyin 1979, and aMaster of Sciencedegree inEngineering Sciencefrom the U.S.Naval Postgraduate Schoolin 1991.[2]

Navy career
Bursch graduated from the U.S. Naval Academy in 1979, and was designated aNaval Flight Officerin April 1980 atNaval Air Station Pensacola,Florida.[2]After initial training as anA-6E Intruderbombardier/navigator (B/N), he reported toVA-34in January 1981, and deployed to theMediterraneanaboard theaircraft carrierUSSJohn F. Kennedy, and to theNorth AtlanticandIndian OceansaboardUSSAmerica.[2]He attended theU.S. Naval Test Pilot Schoolin January 1984. Upon graduation in December he worked as a project test flight officer flying the A-6 Intruder until August 1984, when he returned to the U.S. Naval Test Pilot School as aflight instructor.[2]In April 1987, Bursch was assigned to the commander,Cruiser-Destroyer Group 1, as strike operations officer, making deployments to the Indian Ocean aboard thecruiserUSSLong Beachand the carrierUSSMidway. Redesignated an Aeronautical Engineering Duty officer (AEDO), he attended the U.S. Naval Postgraduate School inMonterey, California, from July 1989 until his selection to the astronaut program.[2]
He has flown over 3,430 flight hours in more than 35 different aircraft.[2]

Astronaut career
Selected by NASA in January 1990, Bursch became an astronaut in July 1991. His technical assignments to date include: Astronaut Office Operations Development Branch, working on controls and displays for the Space Shuttle and Space Station; Chief of Astronaut Appearances; spacecraft communicator (CAPCOM) in mission control. A veteran of four space flights, Bursch has logged over 227 days in space. He was a mission specialist onSTS-51(1993),STS-68(1994) andSTS-77(1996), and served as flight engineer onInternational Space StationExpedition 4(2001–2002). Dan Bursch and fellow astronautCarl Walzcompleted one of the longest U.S. space flights of 196 days in space. In January 2003, Bursch reported to the Naval Postgraduate School for a two-year assignment as an instructor in the Space Systems Academic Group.[2]
He left NASA in May 2005 and later retired from active duty in July 2005 after 26 years of service in the U.S. Navy. Bursch joinedThe Aerospace Corporationin July 2005 and is currently serving as theNational Reconnaissance Office(NRO) Chair at the Naval Postgraduate School.[2]He is also a member of the Board of Directors at theMcAuliffe-Shepard Discovery Center.[3]

STS-51
STS-51launched from theKennedy Space Center, Florida, on September 12, 1993. During the ten-day mission the crew of five aboard theSpace ShuttleDiscoverydeployed the U.S.Advanced Communications Technology Satellite(ACTS), and theShuttle Pallet Satellite(SPAS) with NASA and German scientific experiments aboard. Following aspacewalkby two crew members to evaluateHubble Space Telescoperepair tools, the crew initiated rendezvous burns and Bursch recovered the SPAS using theRemote Manipulator System(RMS). The mission concluded on September 22, 1993, with the first night landing at the Kennedy Space Center. Mission duration was 236 hours and 11 minutes.[2]

STS-68
STS-68, Space Radar Lab-2 (SRL-2), launched from the Kennedy Space Center, Florida, on September 30, 1994. As part of NASA'sMission to Planet Earth, SRL-2 was the second flight of three advanced radars called SIR-C/X-SAR (Spaceborne Imaging Radar-C/X-Band Synthetic Aperture Radar), and a carbon-monoxide pollution sensor, MAPS (Measurement of Air Pollution from Satellites). SIR-C/X-SAR and MAPS operated together inEndeavour's cargo bay to study Earth's surface and atmosphere, creating radar images of Earth's surface environment and mapping global production and transport of carbon monoxide pollution. Real-time crew observations of environmental conditions, along with over 14,000 photographs aided the science team in interpreting the SRL data. The SRL-2 mission was a highly successful test of technology intended for long-term environmental and geological monitoring of planet Earth. Following 183orbitsof the Earth, the eleven-day mission ended with Space ShuttleEndeavourlanding atEdwards Air Force Base,California, on October 11, 1994. Mission duration was 269 hours and 46 minutes.[2]

STS-77
STS-77launched from the Kennedy Space Center on May 19, 1996. It included the fourth Spacehab module flight as a scientific laboratory, designated SPACEHAB-4. It consisted of 12 separate materials processing, fluid physics and biotechnology experiments, with an emphasis on commercial space product development. STS-77 completed a record four rendezvous in support of two satellites sponsored by theGoddard Space Flight Center, and the SPARTAN 207/Inflatable Antenna Experiment (IAE) and the Passive Aerodynamically stabilized Magnetically damped Satellite/Satellite Test Unit (PAMS/STU). Following 160 orbits of the Earth, the ten-day mission ended with Space ShuttleEndeavourlanding at the Kennedy Space Center on May 29, 1996. Mission duration was 240 hours and 39 minutes.[2]

Expedition 4
TheExpedition 4crew launched on December 5, 2001 aboardSTS-108and docked with the International Space Station on December 7, 2001. During a 6½ month stay aboard the Space Station, theExpedition 4crew of three (two American astronauts and one Russian cosmonaut) performed flight tests of the station hardware, conducted internal and external maintenance tasks, and developed the capability of the station to support the addition of science experiments. The crew spent 196 days in space establishing a U.S. space flight endurance record for Dan Bursch and crew mateCarl Walz. Wearing the RussianOrlanspacesuit, Bursch logged 11 hours and 48 minutes of EVA time in two separate spacewalks. The Expedition-Four crew returned to Earth aboardSTS-111, withEndeavourlanding at Edwards Air Force Base, California, on June 19, 2002.[2]

Special honors
Awarded theDefense Superior Service Medal,NASA Space Flight Medals, theNavy Commendation Medaland theNavy Achievement Medal. Distinguished graduate, U.S. Naval Academy and U.S. Naval Test Pilot School.[2]

Personal life
Daniel Bursch was born inBristol, Pennsylvania, but he considersVestal, New York, to be his hometown.[2]He has four children, two daughters and two sons, and two grandchildren, and he is married to Sharon Yencharis.
