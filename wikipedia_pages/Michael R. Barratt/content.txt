Michael Reed Barratt(born April 16, 1959) is an Americanphysicianand aNASA astronaut.Board certifiedininternalandaerospace medicine, he served as aflight surgeonfor NASA before his selection as an astronaut and has played a role in developing NASA's space medicine programs for both theShuttle–Mir programandInternational Space Station. His first spaceflight was a long-duration mission to the International Space Station as a flight engineer on theExpedition 19and20crew. In March 2011, Barratt completed his second spaceflight as a crew member ofSTS-133. Barratt made a second long-duration mission to the International Space Station as a flight engineer on theExpedition 70,71, and72crew and also served as the pilot on theSpaceX Crew-8mission.

Education
Barratt graduated from Camas High School in 1977. He graduated from theUniversity of Washingtonin 1981 with aBachelor of Sciencedegree inzoology, going on to earn anM.D.fromNorthwestern Universityin 1985. He completed a three-year residency ininternal medicineat Northwestern University in 1988; his Chief Residency year was at Veterans Administration Lakeside Hospital in Chicago in 1989. In 1991, Barratt completed both a residency and aMaster of Scienceinaerospace medicinejointly run byWright State University,NASA, andWright-Patterson Air Force Base.[2]He is board certified in Internal and Aerospace Medicine.
Barratt holds a private pilot's license and has been qualified on NASA'sT-38 Talons.[2]

NASA career
Barratt first came to NASA'sJohnson Space Centerin May 1991 as a project physician working forKRUG Life Sciences, serving on the Health Maintenance Facility Project as manager of the Hyperbaric and Respiratory Subsystems for theSpace Station Freedomproject. In July 1992, he was hired by NASA as anaviation medical examinerworking in Space Shuttle Medical Operations.
In July 1993, Barratt was one of a team of the first three Americans invited to witness the recovery of aSoyuz spacecraft. Asked to help evaluate the potential of the Soyuz as aCrew Return Vehiclefor a NASA space station, he flew with the recovery team that picked up the crew ofSoyuz TM-16after they landed in Kazakhstan.[2][3](The Soyuz was ultimately chosen as the return vehicle for the International Space Station).
In January 1994, he was assigned to theShuttle-Mir Program. He spent over 12 months working and training in theGagarin Cosmonaut Training CenterinStar City, Russiaas one of two flight surgeons supportingNorman Thagardand his backupBonnie Dunbar, a role that often included negotiations to resolve different approaches to medicine by NASA and Russian doctors. Barratt and fellow flight surgeon David Ward developed a Mir Supplemental Medical Kit to augment Russian equipment on Mir and developed a program of training for its use, taught to both NASA astronauts and Russian cosmonauts.[2][3]
Thagard launched to Mir aboardSoyuz TM-21and returned to earth onSTS-71; during the 115-day flight, Barratt and Ward effectively served asCAPCOMsfor the NASA Shuttle-Mir team in addition to their duties as flight surgeons.[2][3]
From July 1995 through July 1998, Barratt served as Medical Operations Lead for the International Space Station (ISS). A frequent traveler to Russia, he worked with counterparts at Star City and theInstitute of Biomedical Problemsand other ISS partner centers, developing medical procedures, training, and equipment for ISS. Barratt served as lead crew surgeon for ISSExpedition 1from July 1998 until selected as an astronaut candidate. He serves as Associate Editor for Space Medicine for the journalAviation, Space, and Environmental Medicineand is senior editor of the textbookPrinciples of Clinical Medicine for Space Flight.[4]
Barratt was selected by NASA to joinAstronaut Group 18as amission specialistin July 2000. Barratt reported for training in August 2000. Following the completion of two years of training and evaluation, he was assigned technical duties in the Astronaut Office Station Operations Branch.[4]

NEEMO 7
In October 2004, Barratt served as anaquanautduring theNEEMO 7mission aboard theAquariusunderwater laboratory, living and working underwater for eleven days. During NEEMO 7 the crew tested technologies and procedures for remote surgery, as well as using virtual reality for telemedicine.[5][6]

Expedition 19/20
Barratt was assigned to theExpedition 19crew in February 2008[7]and launched to the International Space Station in March 2009 aboardSoyuz TMA-14. His stay aboard the ISS continued until the end ofExpedition 20in October 2009.[8]
During Expedition 20, Barratt performed both an EVA and IVA together withGennady Padalka. The first EVA, on June 5, 2009, lasted for 4 hours and 54 minutes and prepared theZvezdaservice module transfer compartment for the arrival of thePoiskmodule, installed docking antenna for the module, photographed an antenna for evaluation on the ground, and photographed the Strela-2 crane.[9][10]The second was an internal spacewalk (IVA) in the depressurizedZvezdatransfer compartment to replace one of theZvezdahatches with a docking cone in preparation for the docking of thePoiskmodule later in 2009. This IVA lasted 12 minutes.[11][12]
Barratt returned to Earth on October 11, 2009 after spending 198 days, 16 hours, and 42 minutes in space[1]on Soyuz TMA-14 along with Padalka and space touristGuy Laliberté.[13]

STS-133
Barratt next flew to space as amission specialistonSTS-133, the final flight ofSpace ShuttleDiscovery. The mission launched on February 24, 2011, and landed on March 9, 2011. The mission transported several items to the space station, including thePermanent Multipurpose ModuleLeonardo, which was left permanently docked at one of the station's ports. The shuttle also carried the third of fourExPRESS Logistics Carriersto the ISS, as well as ahumanoid robotcalledRobonaut.[14]During the mission Barratt was in charge of robotics activities. The total duration of STS-133 was 12 days, 19 hours, and 4 minutes.[1]

Post-Shuttle era
From January 2012 through April 2013, Barratt was manager of the Human Research Program atNASA Johnson Space Center, researching the health and performance risks associated with long-duration human spaceflight and mitigating them.[4]
In 2013, Barratt served as cavenaut during theESA CAVEStraining inSardinia, alongside fellow NASA astronautJack Fisher, CSA astronautJeremy Hansen, JAXA astronautSatoshi Furukawa, ESA astronautPaolo Nespoli, and Roscosmos cosmonautAleksey Ovchinin.[15]

Expedition 70/71/72
Barratt made a second long-duration mission to the International Space Station as a flight engineer on theExpedition 70,71, and72crew and also served as the pilot on theSpaceX Crew-8mission, which launched on March 4, 2024.[16][17]The mission successfully splashed down on October 25, 2024, concluding a nearly eight-month science mission.[4]

Personal life
Born inVancouver, Washington, Barratt considersCamas, Washingtonto be his hometown. He is married to Dr. Michelle Lynne Barratt (née Sasynuik); they reside inLeague City, Texas, and have five children. His father and mother, Joseph and Donna Barratt, reside in Camas. His personal and recreational interests include family and church activities, writing, sailing,[18]and boat restoration and maintenance.[4]
