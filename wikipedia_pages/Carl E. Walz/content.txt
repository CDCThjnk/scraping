Space flight experience
STS-51Discovery(12–22 September 1993). During the mission, the five-member crew deployed the U.S. Advanced Communications Technology Satellite (ACTS), and theShuttle Pallet Satellite(SPAS) with NASA and German scientific experiments aboard. Walz also participated in a 7-hour spacewalk (EVA) to evaluate tools for the Hubble Space Telescope servicing mission. The mission was accomplished in 9 days, 22 hours, and 12 minutes.[7]
STS-65Columbia(8–23 July 1994). STS-65 flew the second International Microgravity Laboratory (IML-2) Spacelab module and carried a crew of seven. During the 15-day flight, the crew conducted more than 80 experiments focusing on materials and life sciences research in microgravity. The mission completed 236 orbits of the Earth, traveling 6.1 million miles, setting a new flight duration record for the Shuttle program.[8]
STS-79Atlantis(16–26 September 1996). On STS-79 the six-member crew aboard Atlantis docked with the RussianMirstation, delivered food, water, U.S. scientific experiments and Russian equipment, and exchanged NASA long duration crewmembers. During the mission, the Atlantis/Mir complex set a record for docked mass in space. STS-79 was the first flight of the doubleSpacehabmodule and landed at KSC after 10 days 3 hours and 13 minutes.[9]
TheExpedition 4crew launched on 5 December 2001, aboardSTS-108and docked with theInternational Space Stationon 7 December 2001. During a 6½ month stay aboard the Space Station, the crew of three (two American astronauts and one Russian cosmonaut) performed flight tests of the station hardware, conducted internal and external maintenance tasks, and developed the capability of the station to support the addition of science experiments. Wearing the RussianOrlan space suit, Walz logged 11 hours and 52 minutes of EVA time in two separate spacewalks. The Expedition 4 crew returned to Earth aboard STS-111, withEndeavourlanding atEdwards Air Force Base,California, on 19 June 2002.[10]
