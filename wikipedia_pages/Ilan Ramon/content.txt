NASA experience

NASA on-ground trainings
In 1997, Ramon was selected as aPayload Specialist. He was designated to train as prime for a space shuttle mission with a payload that included amultispectralcamera for recording desertaerosol(dust). In July 1998, Ramon reported for training at theJohnson Space CenterinHouston, Texas, where he trained until 2003. Ramon flew aboardSTS-107, logging 15 days, 22 hours and 20 minutes in space.

Space flight: STS-107, Space ShuttleColumbia
STS-107Columbia(January 16 – February 1, 2003), a 16-day flight, was a dedicated science and research mission. Working 24 hours a day, in two alternating shifts, the crew successfully conducted approximately 80 experiments.
Personally nonreligious, Ramon performed traditional observance while in orbit: "I feel I am representing all Jews and all Israelis." He was the first astronaut to requestkosherfood and marked the Sabbath.[9]Ramon, whose mother and grandmother were survivors ofAuschwitz, was asked by S. Isaac Mekel, director of development at the American Society forYad Vashem, to take an item from Yad Vashem aboard STS-107. Ramon carried with him a pencil sketch,Moon Landscape, drawn by 16-year-oldPetr Ginz, who was murdered in Auschwitz. Ramon also took with him amicrofichecopy of theTorahgiven to him by Israeli presidentMoshe Katsavand a miniature Torah scroll (from the Holocaust) that was given to him by Prof. Yehoyachin Yosef, aBergen Belsensurvivor.[10]Ramon asked the 1939 Club, aHolocaust survivororganization in Los Angeles, for a symbol of the Holocaust to take into outer space with him. A barbed wiremezuzahby theSan FranciscoartistAimee Golantwas selected. Ramon also took with him a dollar of the Lubavitcher Rebbe, RabbiMenachem M. Schneerson.[11]
Ramon and the rest of theColumbiacrew died over East Texas in theSouthern United Statesduring entry into Earth's atmosphere, 16 minutes before scheduled landing.[6]

Diary
Among the recovered 40% from the contents of theColumbiaSpace Shuttle that crashed outsidePalestine, Texas, were 37 pages of Ramon's diary, which NASA returned to his wife.[12][13]His widow, Rona,[12]shared an excerpt with the Israeli public in a display atJerusalem'sIsrael Museum.[14]Rona Ramon brought it to Israel Museumforensicexperts. Only two pages were displayed, one containing Ramon's notes, and the other is a copy of theKiddushprayer.[14]CuratorYigal Zalmona[15]said thediarywas partially restored in one year, and needed four more, for police scientists to decipher 80% of the text. Zalmona stated: "The diary survived extreme heat in the explosion, extreme atmospheric cold, and then was attacked by microorganisms and insects. It's almost a miracle that it survived — it's incredible. There is 'no rational explanation' for how it was recovered when most of the shuttle was not."[14]Ramon wrote on the last day of the journal:
Today was the first day that I felt that I am truly living in space. I have become a man who lives and works in space.
Inscribed in black ink andpencil, it covered the first six days of the 16-day mission.[16]

Family
Ramon was survived by his wife, Rona, and their four children: Assaf, Tal, Yiftah, and Noa, who were in Florida at the time of the accident.

Assaf Ramon
Ramon's eldest son, Assaf (February 10, 1988 – September 13, 2009), died at age 21 during a routine training flight while piloting hisF-16A, three months after graduating from theIAFflight schoolHatzerim Airbaseas the top cadet in his class.[17][18][19][20]Assaf lost consciousness during a spell of vertigo, as a result of the high speed and G-force conditions to which he was subjected. This led to the plane crash and Assaf's subsequent death. He was considered an excellent pilot.[21]A lieutenant of theIsraeli Air Force, he was posthumously promoted to the rank of captain.[21]

Rona Ramon
Ramon's widow,Rona Ramon, served in the Israel Defense Forces as a paramedic and later earned a BA at theWingate Institute. After Assaf's death, she returned to university and graduated with a master's degree in holistic health atLesley University, Massachusetts. She also lectured about dealing with grief and finding coping mechanisms. Rona served as founding CEO of the nonprofit Ramon Foundation for youth academic excellence and social leadership through science and technology.[22]She died of pancreatic cancer on December 17, 2018.[23]She was posthumously awarded theIsrael Prizefor lifetime achievement.

Tal Ramon
On November 10, 2013, the American Society for Yad Vashem held a special event with the participation of Ramon's son, Tal, who performed a song he wrote in memory of his father.[24]Tal Ramon performed his debut album,Dmut, at the club Zappa Tel Aviv in 2016.[24]
