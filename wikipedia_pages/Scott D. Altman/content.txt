As of November 2022, he is the president of the Space operating group for ASRC Federal.[1]

Personal life
Altman was born inLincoln, Illinois. He is married to the former Jill Shannon Loomer ofTucson, Arizonaand has three children, the second oldest of whom graduatedRice UniversityinHouston, Texasin May 2009.[2]He is a resident ofPekin, Illinois, along with his parents, Fred and Sharon Altman. The Pekin District 108 school board voted to honor the former astronaut by naming Scott Altman Primary School in 2010.[3]Scott's sister Sarah Beardsley is the publisher ofVenus Zine, a women's music, DIY and culture multi-media company. He is a brother of theSigma Chifraternity.

Education
 - 1977: Graduated from Pekin Community High School,Pekin, Illinois
 - 1981: ReceivedBachelor of Sciencedegree inaeronauticalandastronautical engineeringfrom theUniversity of Illinois, where he became a member of theSigma Chifraternity
 - 1990: ReceivedMaster of Sciencedegree in aeronautical engineering from the U.S.Naval Postgraduate School

Military career
After being rejected from the United States Air Force for being too tall, Altman instead enlisted in the United States Navy. He was commissioned as anensignin August 1981, and received hisNaval Aviatorwingsin February 1983.[4]As a member ofFighter Squadron 51at(then) NAS Miramar, Altman completed two deployments to theWestern PacificandIndian Oceanflying theF-14A Tomcatfrom theUSSCarl Vinson. In August 1987, he was selected for the Naval Postgraduate School-Test Pilot SchoolCo-op program and graduated with Test Pilot School Class 97 in June 1990 as a Distinguished Graduate. After graduation, he spent the next two years as atest pilotworking on various F-14 projects at Strike Aircraft Test Directorate NAWC AD Patuxent River Maryland. Altman then took the newF-14Don its first operational deployment withVF-31 Tomcatters, where he served as maintenance officer and later operations officer. He was awarded theAir Medalfor his role as a strike leader flying over SouthernIraqin support ofOperation Southern Watch. Shortly following his return from this six-month deployment, he was selected for the NASA astronaut program. He has logged over 7,000 flight hours in more than 40 types of aircraft. During his Navy service, Altman had the callsigns "Scooter" and "D-Bear".[4]

Involvement inTop Gunfilm
Altman performed many of the aerial stunts in the 1986 filmTop Gun, most notably in the scene whereTom Cruise's character,Maverick,"flips the bird"at the enemy MiG pilot (played byRobert F. Willard).[5]
In a NASA interview prior to his 2000 spaceflight, Scott Altman commented[6]on his role as an F-14 pilot involved in the filming ofTop Gun:
Well, Top Gun was a real thrill. I still remember that so vividly. The word was going around town that Hollywood was coming to Miramar, where I was stationed, and they were going to do a movie, and we were all kind of excited. My squadron had just gotten back from a seven-and-a-half-month cruise about a week and a half before, so our airplanes were at home, we were available, we weren't too highly tasked. And it turned out they picked my squadron to supply the F-14s.
Then the skipper got together and tried to pick four guys that he thought, were mature enough, I guess, to handle, you know, the capability that they were being given in working with the movie, and all the things that were required. And the director wanted to have a small cadre of people that he could work with so you develop an understanding of what the movie folks want versus what we can do and how to try and balance those two requirements.
The flying was incredible. You know, most Navy pilots don't get to buzz the tower like in the movie – if you did you could just peel your wings off and, throw 'em at the door because you probably wouldn't be flying anymore – but, since it was Hollywood, you know, they wanted the scene. I had to buzz the tower. And, of course, they wanted nine different takes – so we did it nine times!

NASA career
Selected as an astronaut candidate by NASA in December 1994, Altman reported to theLyndon B. Johnson Space Centerin March 1995. He completed a year of training and was initially assigned to work technical aspects of orbiter landing and roll out issues for the Astronaut Office Vehicle Systems Branch. He was the pilot onSTS-90(1998) andSTS-106(2000), and was the mission commander onSTS-109(2002) andSTS-125(2009). A veteran of four space flights, Altman has logged over 40 days in space. Altman retired from NASA in September 2010 to join ASRC Federal Research and Technology Solutions inGreenbelt, Maryland.[7]

Spaceflights
STS-90Neurolab (April 17 to May 3, 1998). During the 16-daySpacelabflight the seven person crew aboardSpace ShuttleColumbiaserved as both experiment subjects and operators for 26 individual life science experiments focusing on the effects of microgravity on the brain and nervous system.
STS-106Atlantis(September 8–20, 2000). During the 12-day mission, the crew successfully prepared theInternational Space Stationfor the arrival of the first permanent crew. Additionally, he handflew two complete flyarounds of the station after undocking.
STS-109Columbia(March 1–12, 2002). STS-109 was the fourthHubble Space Telescope(HST) servicing mission. The STS-109 crew successfully upgraded the Hubble Space Telescope leaving it with a new power unit, a new camera and new solar arrays. HST servicing and upgrade was accomplished by four crewmembers during a total of 5 EVAs in 5 consecutive days. Thespace walkerswere assisted by crewmates inside Space ShuttleColumbia. STS-109 orbited the Earth 165 times, and covered 3.9 million miles in over 262 hours, culminating in a night landing atKennedy Space Center,Florida.
STS-125Atlantis(May 11–24, 2009). STS-125 was the fifth and final servicing mission to the Hubble Space Telescope.Atlantiscarried two new instruments to the telescope, the Cosmic Origins Spectrograph and the Wide Field Camera 3. The mission also replaced a Fine Guidance Sensor, six gyroscopes, and two battery unit modules to allow the telescope to continue to function at least through 2014. The crew also installed new thermal blanket insulating panels to provide improved thermal protection, and a soft-capture mechanism that would aid in the safe de-orbiting of the telescope by an uncrewed spacecraft at the end of its operational lifespan. The mission also carried an IMAX camera and the crew documented the progress of the mission for an upcoming IMAX film.
