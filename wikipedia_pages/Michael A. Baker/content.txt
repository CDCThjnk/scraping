Michael Allen Baker(born October 27, 1953) is a retiredcaptainin theUnited States Navy,  formerNASAastronaut, and theInternational Space StationProgram Manager for International and Crew Operations, at NASA'sJohnson Space Center.  He is responsible for the coordination of program operations, integration and flight crew training and support activities with the International Partners.

Early life
Baker was born on October 27, 1953, inMemphis, Tennessee, and considersLemoore, Californiato be his hometown. He was active in theBoy Scouts of Americawhere he achieved its second highest rank,Life Scout. Baker graduated fromLemoore Union High School, Lemoore, California, in 1971, and received aBachelor of Sciencedegree inAerospace Engineeringfrom theUniversity of Texasin 1975, where he was a member of theTejas Club. He has two children.[2]

Naval service
After graduation, Baker completed flight training and earned hisWings of Goldas aNaval AviatoratNaval Air Station Chase Field,Beeville, Texas, in 1977. In 1978, he was assigned to Attack Squadron 56 (VA-56), embarked on theaircraft carrierUSSMidway, homeported inYokosuka, Japan, where he flew theA-7 Corsair II. In late 1980, he was assigned to Carrier Air Wing 30 as the Air WingLanding Signal Officer.[2]
He attended theU.S. Naval Test Pilot Schoolin 1981 and, after graduation, was assigned to the Carrier Suitability Branch of the Strike Aircraft Test Directorate. While there, Baker conducted carrier suitability structural tests, aircraft carrier catapult and arresting gear certification tests, and automatic carrier landing system certification and verification tests on the various aircraft carriers of the Navy's fleet in the A-7 Corsair II aircraft.[2]
In 1983, he returned to the U.S. Naval Test Pilot School as an instructor. He was then assigned as the U.S. Navy exchange instructor at theEmpire Test Pilots' SchoolinBoscombe Down,England, teaching performance, flying qualities and systems flight test techniques.[2]
He has logged over 5,400 hours flying time in approximately 50 different types of airplanes, including tacticaljets,VSTOL, multi-engine transport androtary wingaircraft, and has over 300 carrier landings to his credit.[2]

NASA
Selected by NASA in June 1985, Baker became an astronaut in July 1986 upon completion of a one-year training and evaluation program.
Following theChallengeraccident, Baker was assigned from January 1986 to December 1987 as a member of the team that was pursuing redesign, modification and improvements to the Shuttle Landing and Deceleration Systems, to include nosewheel steering, brakes, tires, and drag chute, in an effort to provide greater safety margins during landing and rollout. He was then assigned to theShuttle Avionics Integration Laboratory, where he was involved in the checkout and verification of the computer software and hardware interfaces forSTS-26(the return-to-flight mission) and subsequent flights.
Baker then served as an ascent, entry and orbit spacecraft communicator (CAPCOM) for Shuttle missionsSTS-27,STS-29,STS-30,STS-28,STS-34,STS-33,STS-32,STS-36,STS-31,STS-38, andSTS-35. His duties included communication with the Shuttle crew during simulations and actual missions, as well as working procedural problems and modifications between missions. He served as the leader of the Astronaut Support Personnel team at theKennedy Space Centerfor Shuttle missionsSTS-44,STS-42andSTS-45. He was assigned as the Flight Crew Operations Directorate Representative to theSpace Shuttle Program Officefrom December 1992 to January 1994.
Between March and October 1995, he served as the Director of Operations for NASA at theGagarin Cosmonaut Training CenterinStar City, Russia. He was responsible for the coordination and implementation of mission operation activities in theMoscowregion for the joint U.S./Russian Shuttle/Mir program. From October 1997 to August 2001, he was the assistant director of Johnson Space Center (JSC) for Human Space Flight Programs, Russia and was responsible for implementation and integration of NASA's Human Space Flight Programs in Russia. Those activities includedInternational Space Station(ISS) training, operations, technical liaison, logistics and personnel administration support. He also served as the NASA JSC representative to theRussian Space Agency, Gagarin Cosmonaut Training Center, Star City; Mission Control Center-Moscow,EnergiaRocket andSpacecraft Corporation, Krunichev State Scientific and Production Space Center and other Russian government agencies and manufacturers involved in the ISS program. After his return to JSC in August 2001, he was assigned as the International Space Station Program Manager for International Operations responsible for the coordination of program operations, integration and flight crew training and support activities with the International Partners.

Space flights
A veteran of fourspace flights, Baker has logged 965 hours in space. He served as pilot onSTS-43(August 2–11, 1991) andSTS-52(October 22 to November 1, 1992), and was the mission commander onSTS-68(September 30 to October 11, 1994) andSTS-81(January 12–22, 1997).
STS-43Space ShuttleAtlantislaunched from the Kennedy Space Center,Florida, on August 2, 1991. During the flight, crew members deployed the fifthTracking and Data Relay Satellite(TDRS-E), in addition to conducting 32 physical, material, and life science experiments, mostly relating to theExtended Duration OrbiterandSpace Station Freedom. After 142 orbits of the Earth, the 9-day mission concluded with a landing on Runway 15 at the Kennedy Space Center on August 11, 1991. Mission duration was 213 hours, 21 minutes, 25 seconds.[3]
STS-52Space ShuttleColumbialaunched from the Kennedy Space Center, Florida, on October 22, 1992. During the mission crew members deployed the Italian Laser Geodynamic Satellite (LAGEOS), used to measure movement of the Earth's crust, and operated the U.S. Microgravity Payload 1 (USMP-1). Additionally, theAdvanced Space Vision System(SVS) developed by theCanadian Space Agencywas tested by the Canadianpayload specialistand the crew using a small target assembly that was released from the remote manipulator system. The SVS will be used for Space Station construction. These three primary payloads together with numerous other payloads operated by the crew encompassed geophysics, materials science, biological research and applied research for Space Station Freedom. Following 159 orbits of the Earth, the 10-day mission concluded with a landing on Runway 33 at the Kennedy Space Center on November 1, 1992. Mission duration was 236 hours, 56 minutes, 13 seconds.[4]
STS-68Space ShuttleEndeavourlaunched from the Kennedy Space Center, Florida, on September 30, 1994. This flight was the second flight of the Space Radar Laboratory (SRL), which consists of a large radar called SIR-C/X-SAR (Shuttle Imaging Radar-C/X-Band Synthetic Aperture Radar) and MAPS (Measurement of Air Pollution from Satellites). As part of NASA's Mission to Planet Earth, SRL was an international, multidisciplinary study of global environmental change, both natural and man-made. The primary objective was to radar map the surface of the Earth to help us understand the contributions ofecology,hydrology,geology, andoceanographyto changes in our Planet's environment. Real-time crew observations of environmental conditions, along with over 14,000 photographs, aided in interpretation of the radar images. This SRL mission was a highly successful test of technology intended for long-term environmental and geological monitoring of planet Earth. Following 183 orbits of the Earth, the eleven-day mission concluded with a landing on Runway 22 atEdwards Air Force Base,California, on October 11, 1994. Mission duration was 269 hours, 46 minutes, 10 seconds.[5]
STS-81Space ShuttleAtlantislaunched from the Kennedy Space Center, Florida on January 12, 1997. STS-81 was the fifth in a series of joint missions between the U.S.Space Shuttleand the Russian Space StationMirand the second one involving an exchange of U.S. astronauts. In five days of docked operations more than three tons of food, water, experiment equipment and samples were moved back and forth between the two spacecraft. Following 160 orbits of the Earth the STS-81 mission concluded with a landing on Kennedy Space Center's Runway 33 ending a 3.9 million mile journey. Mission duration was 244 hours, 56 minutes.[6]

Post NASA
In January 2017, Baker left NASA to work for the private industry.[1]He currently resides inLeague City, Texas.
