The Inertial Upper Stage (IUS), combined with the Payload Assist Module (PAM-S),[3]: 1propelled Ulysses towards Jupiter for a gravity assist, slingshotting the spacecraft to its out-of-ecliptic orbit for solar observations.[5]Additionally, STS-41 conducted experiments like the Shuttle Solar Backscatter Ultraviolet Instrument (SSBUV), which studied Earth's upper atmosphere,[6]investigations into polymer membrane production (IPMP),[3]: 1Chromosome and Plant Cell Division in Space (CHROMEX),[3]: 1and more.
The STS-41 mission concluded with the successful landing ofDiscoveryatEdwards Air Force Base, Runway 22, on October 10, 1990, at 13:57:19 UTC.[3]: 3

The primary mission objective involved a series of spacewalks aimed at capturing and repairing the stranded Intelsat VI satellite.[8]: 1Multiple spacewalks were conducted to retrieve, repair, and redeploy the satellite.[7]The mission featured the first three-person spacewalk, which was an unplanned solution to challenges encountered during the satellite capture.[8]: 3These spacewalks showcased technical proficiency in orbital servicing and repair and set a record for the longest-duration spacewalks at the time.[7]
STS-49 concluded with the safe landing ofEndeavourat the Edwards Air Force Base, Runway 22 on May 16, 1992, at 20:57:38 UTC.[8]: 4
