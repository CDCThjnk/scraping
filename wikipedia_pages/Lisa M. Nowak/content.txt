Lisa Marie Nowak(néeCaputo; born May 10, 1963) is an Americanaeronautical engineer, formerNASA astronaut, and retiredUnited States Navyofficer. Nowak served asnaval flight officerandtest pilotin the Navy, and was selected by NASA forNASA Astronaut Group 16in 1996, qualifying as amission specialistinrobotics. She flew in space aboardSpace ShuttleDiscoveryduring theSTS-121mission in July 2006, when she was responsible for operating therobotic armsof the shuttle and theInternational Space Station. In 2007, Nowak was involved in a highly publicized incident of criminal misconduct for which she eventually pleaded guilty to felony burglary and misdemeanor battery charges, resulting in her demotion fromcaptaintocommander, termination by NASA, and forced retirement from the Navy.
Born in Washington, D.C., Nowak graduated from theUnited States Naval AcademyinAnnapolis, Maryland, in 1985. She was assigned toVAQ-34atNaval Air Station Point Mugu, California, where she flew theEA-7L CorsairandERA-3B Skywarrior. She earned aMaster of Science degreeinaeronautical engineeringand a degree in aeronautical and astronautical engineering from theNaval Postgraduate SchoolinMonterey, California. In 1993 she was selected to attend theU.S. Naval Test Pilot SchoolatNaval Air Station Patuxent River, Maryland. After graduation, she remained at Patuxent River, flying in theF/A-18 HornetandEA-6B Prowler. During her Navy career she logged over 1,500 hours in more than 30 aircraft and was awarded theDefense Meritorious Service Medal, theNavy Commendation Medaland theNavy Achievement Medal.
In February 2007, Nowak was arrested inOrlando, Florida, after she accosted andpepper-sprayedColleen Shipman, aU.S. Air Forcecaptainromantically involved with astronautWilliam Oefelein, who had been in a relationship with Nowak. She was released on bail and initially pleaded not guilty to the charges, which included attempted kidnapping, burglary with assault, and battery. Subsequently, her assignment as an astronaut was terminated by NASA. In 2009, Nowak agreed to aplea dealwith prosecutors and pleaded guilty to charges of felony burglary of a car andmisdemeanor battery. She remained a Navy captain until the following year when aNaval Board of Inquiryvoted unanimously toreduce her in rankto commander and to retire her from the Navy underother than honorable conditionsafter 25 years of service. As of 2017,[update]it was reported that she was working in the private sector in Texas.

Early life and education
Lisa Marie Caputo was born in Washington, D.C., on May 10, 1963, to Alfredo F. Caputo, a computer consultant, and Jane L. Caputo, a biological specialist.[1][2]Caputo and her two younger sisters, Andrea and Marisa, grew up inRockville, Maryland.[3]In 1969, she watched theApollo 11Moon mission and became interested in thespace program. While growing up, she followed theSpace Shuttle program, particularly theintroduction of female astronautsin 1978,[4]and paid frequent visits to theNational Air and Space Museum.[5]
Caputo was educated at Luxmanor Elementary School,[3]Tilden Middle School, andCharles W. Woodward High SchoolinNorth Bethesda, Maryland. In the January of herjunioryear of high school, she told her mother that she was going to become an astronaut.[5]She was aGirl Scout,[6]and a member of theSociété Honoraire de Français, which required students to maintain an A average in French and a B average in all other subjects.[7]She competed on the math team and served on her class student council. She playedfield hockeyand competed intrack and field athletics. In 1981 she was named Student Athlete of the Year, a school award granted to the student who excelled most in both sports and academics, and graduated as co-valedictorian.[8]In her final year of high school, Caputo was accepted byBrown University, a privateIvy Leagueuniversity inProvidence, Rhode Island, and by theUnited States Naval AcademyinAnnapolis, Maryland. Her parents thought Brown was the best choice, but Caputo felt that she had more chance of achieving her goal of becoming an astronaut by going to the Naval Academy.[8]
Women were first admitted to Annapolis in 1976,[9]and by the time Caputo entered as aplebein 1981, there were women in each of the four classes, but were only 6 percent of the student body.[10]Female midshipmen were still harassed by some male classmates in 1981, and occasionally a male professor would inform a class that he did not think women belonged there.[11]As a student, she competed on the track team.[12]She graduated on May 22, 1985,[13]with aBachelor of Science degreeinaeronautical engineering, and was commissioned as anensignin theUnited States Navy.[12]

Navy career
For her first assignment, Caputo chose a six-monthsecondmentto theJohnson Space Center, where she worked as an aerospace engineer at its branch atEllington Air Force BasenearHouston, Texas. During this time, there were sixSpace Shuttlelaunches. "What impressed me", she later said, "was the whole idea that everybody was so into what they were doing and excited that each of their parts was so important."[14]
In December 1985, Caputo received orders to report toNaval Air Station Pensacolain Florida for flight training. By law, women were still banned from combat assignments, so half the jobs in the Navy were unavailable to women regardless of aptitude or ability, and there were doubts about the wisdom of training women for jobs they were not permitted to do. Getting accepted into flight training was a major achievement, and those women that did so were often resented by men who were passed over.[15]Caputo completed primary flight training at Naval Air Station Pensacola on theT-2 Buckeye,T-39 SabrelinerandTA-4J Skyhawkand qualified as anaval flight officer(NFO) in June 1987.[16]
Caputo's NFO training continued at the Electronic Warfare School atCorry Stationin preparation to flyelectronic warfareaircraft. She then went to theNaval Air Station Lemoore, where she qualified to operate the electronic systems on theLTV EA-7L Corsair II.[16]On April 6, 1988, she married an Annapolis classmate, Richard T. Nowak, at theNaval Academy Chapelwith Catholic rites, andchanged her last nameto "Nowak".[17][18]Her next assignment was toElectronic Warfare Aggressor Squadron 34(VAQ-34) atNaval Air Station Point Mugu, California, where she flew on both the Corsair II and theDouglas ERA-3B Skywarrior, supporting theU.S. Pacific Fleeton reconnaissance mission exercises.[19][20]She qualified as a mission commander and electronic warfare lead.[21]
In 1990, Nowak entered the U.S.Naval Postgraduate SchoolinMonterey, California, where she earned both aMaster of Science degreein aeronautical engineering and a degree in aeronautical andastronautical engineeringin September 1992,[19]writing a thesis onComputational Investigations of a NACA 0012 Airfoil in Low Reynolds Number Flows.[22]She gave birth to a son in February 1992.[20]After graduate school, she transferred to therestricted lineas an Aerospace Engineering Duty Officer. She was selected to attend theUnited States Naval Test Pilot SchoolatNaval Air Station Patuxent River,Maryland, after she applied six times.[23][24]She graduated in June 1994, and then became an aircraft systems project officer at the Air Combat Environment Test and Evaluation Facility and at Strike Aircraft Test Squadron at Patuxent River. As a naval flying officer/flight test engineer, she participated in the development of theF/A-18 Hornetand EA-6B Prowler. Her next assignment was to theNaval Air Systems Command, where she was involved in the acquisition of new systems for naval aircraft.[19][23]During her career in the Navy, Nowak logged over 1,500 hours of flight time in more than 30 different aircraft and was awarded theDefense Meritorious Service Medal, theNavy Commendation Medaland theNavy Achievement Medal.[19]

NASA career

Astronaut training
On June 15, 1995, NASA announced that it was selectinga new group of astronauts.[25]As a naval officer, Nowak could not apply directly, like a civilian could, but had to submit her application to a review board that would then approve it and forward it on to NASA, which it did.[26]NASA received over 2,400 applications,[2]and in early 1996, Nowak was informed that she was one of 150 finalists deemed highly qualified, and she was asked to report to Johnson Space Center for a week of orientation, interviews and medical evaluations.[26][27]
On May 1, 1996, NASA publicly announced the names of 10 pilot and 25mission specialistcandidates; Nowak was one of the latter. The class of 1996, the 16th group of NASA astronauts, was the largest selected since the first class of Space Shuttle astronauts in 1978, which also numbered 35. They were ordered to report for duty at Johnson Space Center to commence their astronaut training on August 12, 1996.[2][28]They were joined by nine international astronauts.[29]Because there were so many of them, they were often packed into classrooms and training facilities, and called themselves "The Sardines".[28][30]
Nowak and her family moved to Texas, where they built a house inClear Lake City. Her husband, another naval flight officer, left active duty in 1998 but continued to fly in theUnited States Naval Reserve. He found a job as a space communications contractor with Barrios Technology, an aerospace company, and worked at the Johnson Space Center as aflight controllerat themission control center.[31]
Astronaut training included survival training, a three-day trip to theGrand Canyonto study geology, and classwork on the Space Shuttle's many systems. As a mission specialist, she was expected to fly a minimum of four hours a month in NASA'sNorthrop T-38 Talonaircraft. Training was conducted in the waters of theWeightless Environment Training Facilityand in theBoeing KC-135 Stratotankerknown as theVomit Cometthat flies a trajectory that gives the sensation of being in space. She completed her astronaut training in August 1998. On September 28, 1998, she returned to Annapolis along with fellow astronaut alumniJim Lovell,Charles O. Hobaugh,David Leestma,John M. Lounge,Bryan D. O'ConnorandPierre J. Thuot, for a celebration of the life ofMercury SevenastronautAlan Shepard, who had died two months before.[31]
In early 2001, Nowak became pregnant with twins.[32]At theAstronaut Office, Nowak specialized in the operation of theSpace Shuttle's robotic arm. She also served with theCAPCOMBranch, the astronauts that worked with the mission control center as the primary communicators with the spacecraft.[31]She performed this duty during theSTS-100mission in April 2001, when the crew of theSpace ShuttleEndeavourinstalled arobot armin theInternational Space Station(ISS).[33]In October 2001, she gave birth to twin daughters. Nowak and her husband alternated their work schedules so one of them was always with the children. This arrangement lasted until Richard was recalled to active duty in 2002 to participate inOperation Enduring Freedom, which effectively left Nowak a single mother with three young children.[34]
On December 12, 2002, NASA announced the crew forSTS-118, a mission scheduled for November 2003.Scott Kellywould be the mission commander, Hobaugh  the pilot, and the mission specialists would be Nowak,Scott Parazynski,Dafydd Williams, andBarbara Morgan.[35]TheSpace ShuttleColumbiadisasteron February 1, 2003, killed seven astronauts on theSTS-107mission, including three from Nowak's 1996 astronaut class. It was NASA's practice to provide the families of astronauts who had died with a personal casualty assistance officer, and Nowak performed this duty for the family of her close friendLaurel Clark.[36]Clark's widower, Jonathan Clark, a former NASAflight surgeon, recalled that:
She did everything. She went through everything: Navy paperwork, finances, bills, bank accounts. She took care of [Clark's son] Iain during the months afterward. She saw what it was like to lose one of her best friends and for Iain to lose a mother. And the thing is, while Lisa was doing this, she was not at home with her kids. She has two very young children and she is here twelve to fourteen hours a day under the most difficult circumstances. I have to think it was hugely stressful.[37]
The disaster resulted in a series of schedule and hardware changes. The task of testing all the changes was assigned toSTS-114, the Return to Flight mission, but the list of changes that required testing grew so large that a second Return to Flight mission was added to the schedule to accommodate them. Despite the numbering, this mission,STS-121, would be the second mission flown after theColumbiadisaster. STS-121 was primarily concerned with testing and developing new hardware and procedures to make Space Shuttle flights safer. It would also re-supply the ISS with equipment and consumables.[38]
In January 2004, Nowak participated in an eleven-day cold weather survival training course in Canada with fellow NASA astronautsDominic AntonelliandWilliam Oefelein, Swedish astronautChrister Fuglesang, Russian cosmonautDmitri Kondratyev, and Canadian astronaut (and futureGovernor General)Julie Payette. The course commenced on January 19, and included four days of instruction with theCanadian Armed Forces. They were then dropped off in the wilderness in northernQuebecand had to make their way back on foot. They covered 20 kilometers (12 mi) in eleven days, completing the course on January 29.[39]Nowak had worked together with Oefelein, who had been selected as an astronaut with theclass of 1998, when they were both stationed at Patuxent River in 1995.[40]
When Nowak and Oefelein returned to Houston they began anextramarital affair, which they attempted to conceal.[39]As serving Navy officers, they could have been charged withconduct unbecoming an officer and a gentleman, which includesadultery, under theUniform Code of Military Justice.[41][42]Oefelein's wife filed for divorce in February 2005 after discovering emails between him and Nowak.[43]Their divorce was finalized in May 2005. Oefelein moved into a small apartment,  to which he gave Nowak a key. She left personal effects there, and she soon became a familiar sight to other residents of the complex.[44]

Space flight
NASA announced in December 2003 that STS-121 would be commanded bySteven Lindsey, withMark Kellyas pilot andMichael FossumandCarlos Noriegaas mission specialists.[38]On November 18, 2004, NASA announced that Nowak and her classmateStephanie Wilsonwould join the STS-121 crew as additional mission specialists.[45]They were assigned the task of manipulating the robotic arms of the Space Shuttle and the ISS.[46]The STS-121 mission was originally scheduled for March or April 2005, but was soon postponed to July owing to difficulty implementing all the changes required. During the launch ofSpace ShuttleDiscoveryfor STS-114 in July 2005, debris separated from theexternal tank, the very problem which had caused the loss of theSpace ShuttleColumbia, and STS-121 was further postponed until a solution to the problem could be found.[47]In February 2006, the mission was rescheduled for alaunch windowbetween May 3 and 22,[48]but in March multiple problems forced a further postponement until July.[49]
A prelaunch reception was held for Nowak at theKennedy Space Center Visitor Complex, and she was joined by her parents, her husband Richard and three children, family members, and friends from school, Annapolis and the Navy.[50]Among the personal effects she packed for the flight was a small owl figurine of the mascot of Luxmanor Elementary School, akooziefrom Tilden Middle School, a banner from Charles W. Woodward High School, an Annapolis Class of 1985 flag, and her grandmother's engagement ring.[51]
On July 1, 2006, the STS-121 crew ate the traditional prelaunch cake decorated with the mission's insignia and boardedDiscoveryatKennedy Space Center Launch Complex 39B. Nowak was the last crew member to enter the spacecraft,[52]taking her seat as the flight engineer on the flight deck  immediately behind Lindsey and Kelly.[53]At 15:42, the launch was scrubbed due to thunderstorm activity in the area.[52]A second launch attempt the following day was also canceled due to inclement weather.[54]STS-121 successfully launched on July 4 at 14:38.[55]It was the first time a Space Shuttle launch had taken place onIndependence Day.[56][57]
After she entered orbit, Nowak felt nauseated, a symptom ofspace adaptation syndrome. The first day in space was devoted to inspecting theorbiterfor possible damage, as the crew had noticed debris falling off the external tank during liftoff. Nowak deployed the robotic arm to inspect the wing tips, nose and underside of the spacecraft using digital and video cameras andlaser scanning. After six and a half hours of examination,[56][58][59]all that was found was a white splotch on the nose cap. NASA engineers were initially concerned that this might be the result of a high-velocity impact, but after closer examination they determined it to bebird droppings. Some discoloration found on the leading edges was attributed to hydraulic fluid spills.[58]
AfterDiscoverydocked with the ISS, Wilson and Nowak used theCanadarmto unload the Italian-builtLeonardoMulti-Purpose Logistics Module(MPLM). The 3,400 kilograms (7,400 lb) of equipment and supplies it contained included theMinus Eighty Lab Freezerfor use in scientific experiments and a 640-kilogram (1,400 lb)Oxygen Generation Systemto allow the ISS to support up to six crew members.[58]Nowak carried out her assigned tasks, but other crew members noted a reluctance to assist with tasks that were not assigned to her and for which she had not trained.[60]
WhileDiscoverywas docked with the ISS, the STS-121 crew conducted threespacewalks. The women were not considered for this activity; when NASA trimmed the space suit budget in the 1990s, small sizes were omitted. Women astronauts were assigned to other tasks like operating the robotic arms.[61]From theDestinylaboratory on the ISS, Nowak operated the robotic arm whose installation she had overseen as CAPCOM years before. It was more challenging to operate than the one on the Space Shuttle, since it was larger and had an extra joint.[62][63]
Some 2,000 kilograms (4,300 lb) of trash, experiment results and broken equipment were packed intoLeonardo, and Nowak and Wilson used the robotic arm to re-stow the module inDiscovery's cargo bay. It was then used to make a final check of the Space Shuttle to ensure that no damage had been done bymicrometeoritesorspace debris.Discoveryundocked from the ISS and commenced its two-day return to Earth.[64]In all, she spent 12 days 18 hours and 36 minutes in space,[6]during which she traveled 8 million kilometers (5 million miles).Discoverylanded at theShuttle Landing Facilityat theKennedy Space Centerat 09:14 on July 17.[56]

Homecoming
As was usual, the six crew members of STS-121 embarked on a series of publicity events and interviews. They attendedX Games XIIat theHome Depot Centerin Los Angeles from August 3 to 6, and theHouston Astrosgame on August 14 atMinute Maid Park, where the crew metpitcherRoger Clemensand threw ceremonial first pitches.[65]On September 9, Nowak attended atailgate partyat the Naval Academy versusUniversity of Massachusettsfootball game, where she gave her classmates the Class of 1985 flag she had carried on the Space Shuttle and signed photographs of herself. At half time she presented Annapolis with a Navy jersey she had carried on boardDiscovery. She gave a long interview with theLadies' Home Journalfor its Mother's Day issue and presented awards at NASA'sStennis Space Center. She went back to Luxmanor Elementary School and Tilden Middle School where she spoke to the children and attended celebrations at Annapolis for the 30th anniversary of its admission of women, during which she gave a presentation as part of the academy's Forrestal Lecture Series. In December, the STS-121 crew flew to the UK, where they visited theUniversity of Edinburghand theNational Space CentreinLeicester, and spoke at theUniversity of Leeds, fellow STS-121 crewmemberPiers Sellers's alma mater.[66]

Orlando International Airport incident
Nowak's marriage failed, and she separated from Richard in January 2007.[67]Her relationship with Oefelein also cooled, although she continued to call him almost every day.[66]In late 2006, Oefelein began a relationship with U.S. Air ForceCaptainColleen Shipman, who worked as an engineer with the45th Space WingatPatrick Air Force Basein Florida.[68][69]Oefelein informed Nowak about Shipman in January. He thought Nowak took it well, and that they could remain friends. They continued to train for theMS 150, a charity bicycle race,[70]but Shipman became uncomfortable with Nowak's bicycle being kept at Oefelein's place. She asked him to have Nowak remove it.[71]
On January 29, 2007, NASA announced thatStephanie Wilsonhad been chosen as the mission specialist for theSTS-120mission to replaceMichael Foreman, who had been reassigned to theSTS-123mission, scheduled for February.[72]Nowak had hoped for this assignment. According toMark Kelly, Wilson was chosen because "she was a team player and well deserving. Nowak was not."[73]Nowak was assigned toCAPCOMduties for STS-123 instead.[74]

Altercation
On February 4, 2007, Nowak packed latex gloves, a black wig, aBB pistoland ammunition,pepper spray, a hooded tantrench coat, a drilling hammer, black gloves, an 8-inch (200 mm)Gerberfolding knife and other items. She drove her husband's car 900 miles (1,400 km) from Houston, Texas, to Orlando, Florida, to confront Shipman.[75][76][77][78]Early police reports stated that she woreMaximum Absorbency Garmentsduring the trip, but she later denied this.[79][80]On February 5, 2007, Nowak traveled toOrlando International Airportand waited for Shipman's plane to touch down at 01:05. Shipman went to claim her suitcase, but it was delayed. Shipman finally collected her suitcase from the baggage claim office at 03:15 and took a shuttle bus to the parking area at 03:28.[81]
Shipman said that after arriving, she became aware of someone following her to an airport satellite parking area. When she entered her car, she heard running footsteps and quickly locked the door. Nowak slapped the window and tried to open the car door, asked for a ride, then started crying. Shipman rolled down the window a couple of inches after which Nowak sprayed the pepper spray into the car. Shipman drove to the parking lot booth where she called the police. SeveralOrlando Police DepartmentAirport Division officers arrived minutes later. An officer observed Nowak throwing a bag into a trash receptacle at a parking shuttle bus stop. Nowak was subsequently arrested at the airport on charges of attempted kidnapping, battery, attempted vehicle burglary with battery, anddestruction of evidence.[76][77][82][83]
In a handwritten request for arestraining orderagainst Nowak after her arrest, Shipman referred to Nowak as an acquaintance of her boyfriend, but did not identify Oefelein. She claimed that Nowak had been stalking her for two months.[84]Nowak told investigators she was involved in a relationship with Oefelein, which she described as being "more than a working relationship but less than a romantic relationship".[85]Citing evidence of elaborate planning, disguises and weapons, police recommended she be held without bail.[85][86][87]

Arraignment
Two fellow astronauts flew to Florida in T-38 jets for Nowak'sarraignment:[88]CaptainChristopher Ferguson, the senior active duty Naval Officer in the NASA Astronaut Corps at the time, went as Nowak's commanding officer, and Lindsey, the commander of Nowak's shuttle mission, went asChief of the Astronaut Office, the senior astronaut at NASA.[89][90]On February 6, 2007, both appeared before a judge on her behalf. The state's assistant attorney, Amanda Cowan, argued that the facts indicated a well-thought-out plan to kidnap and perhaps to injure Shipman.[76]In arguing for pre-trial release, Nowak's attorney remarked, "One's good works must count for something."[76]
Nowak was ordered released on $15,500 bail under the condition she wear aGPStracking deviceand not contact Shipman, but before Nowak could be released, Orlando police charged Nowak with attempted first-degree murder and announced she would not be released on bail. Her lawyer alleged that police and prosecutors, unhappy that Nowak had been granted bail, pressed more serious charges solely to keep her in jail.[90][91]In the second arraignment Nowak was charged with attempted first-degree murder with a deadly weapon, for which the judge raised bail by $10,000. After posting bail, Nowak was released from jail.[86]Shipman dropped her request for a protection order on February 15.[92]

Reactions
On February 6, 2007, Nowak was placed on 30-day leave by NASA.[93]She returned to Houston on a commercial airline flight on February 8,[94]and upon arrival was reportedly taken immediately under police escort to the Johnson Space Center for medical and psychiatric evaluation. Nowak's assignment to NASA as a serving Navy officer was terminated by the space agency on March 7, 2007.[95][96][97]There was widespread public reaction to her arrest, concerns being expressed about NASA's astronaut selection and screening processes.[98][99]Some commentators opined that NASA's presentation of astronauts as heroes was part of the problem.[100][101]
In response to concerns over Nowak's mental health,NASA AdministratorMichael D. Griffincommissioned the NASA Astronaut Health Care System Review Committee, an independent panel, to examine how well NASA attended to the mental health of its astronauts.[102]Patricia Santy, a former NASA flight surgeon and the author of the bookChoosing the Right Stuff: Psychological Selection of Astronauts and Cosmonauts, described a culture among the Astronaut Corps to avoid discussing physical and psychological issues with medical personnel, due to the perception that any issues could jeopardize one's career and flight status.[103]Policies at NASA were changed in a variety of ways: flight surgeons would receive further training in psychiatric evaluation,[104]and a new "Astronaut Code of Professional Responsibility" was issued.[105][106]Behavioral health evaluations would be included in the astronauts' annual flight physicals.[104]

Evidence
On April 10, 2007, Florida prosecutors released more material in the case. The previous week, the trial judge had agreed to unseal some of the documents that described items found in Nowak's car after her arrest. Among these items were a handwritten note onUSSNimitzstationery listing Shipman's flight information and one on "Flight Controller's Log" paper listing more than 24 items, including sneakers, plastic gloves, contacts, cash, an umbrella, and black sweats.[107]Afloppy diskcontained two photographs of Nowak riding in a bicycle race, and 15 images depicting an unidentified woman in different stages of undress. An evidence report dated March 15 indicated that nearly all of the photographs and drawings depicted scenes of bondage. Also found were $585 and £41 (GBP) in cash, and four brown paper bags with 69 orange pills that were not publicly identified. Investigators also examined twoUSB flash drivesfound in the car. They contained family pictures, digital movies, and NASA-related materials. Investigators concluded that the information on the disk and USB drives did not have any direct relationship to the alleged kidnapping attempt.[108]
Oefelein had provided Nowak with a cell phone to communicate with him. Phone records show that she called him at least twelve times and sent seven text messages the day after he returned from his Space Shuttle flight on December 22, 2006, that he did not retrieve until December 24, when they had a seven-minute conversation. During December and January, over 100 calls were made, although it is unclear who called whom. Under questioning by NASA and military investigators, Oefelein reportedly stated that he had ended their romantic relationship. He did, however, have lunch with her in his apartment at least once in January, they continued to train together for the bicycle race, and they went to the gym together.[109][110]
On May 11, 2007, authorities released a surveillance video from Orlando International Airport terminal showing Nowak waiting for nearly an hour, standing near the baggage claim, then donning a trench coat and following Shipman after she retrieved her bags.[111]

Developments
On February 6, 2007, Nowak pleaded not guilty to the charges of attempted murder and attempted kidnapping. On March 2, Florida prosecutors filed three formal charges against Nowak: attempted kidnapping with intent to inflict bodily harm or terrorize; burglary of a conveyance with a weapon; and battery. The prosecutors declined to file the attempted murder charge that had been recommended by Orlando police. She was ordered to wear an electronic monitoring ankle bracelet as a condition of her release.[112][113]A pre-trial hearing was held on July 17, 2007, and further hearings were to be held on September 19, to argue defense motions to suppress some of the evidence obtained on the day of her arrest.[109][114][115]On August 12, 2007, Nowak asked to have her GPS ankle bracelet removed,[116]to which the judge agreed on August 30.[117]On August 28, the trial judge unsealed a court document indicating that Nowak intended to pursue an insanity defense. According to documents submitted by her lawyer, Nowak was evaluated by two psychiatrists who diagnosed her withobsessive–compulsive personality disorder,Asperger syndrome, a single episode ofmajor depressive disorderand a "brief psychotic disorderwith marked stressors" at the time of the incident.[118][119][120]
The trial judge suppressed Nowak's initial (pre-Miranda) statements to police, as well as all evidence found in her vehicle, on November 2, 2007, citing police misconduct in their initial search and questioning.[121]The prosecution appealed that ruling on November 8. A hearing on that appeal occurred on October 21, 2008.[122][123]
On December 5, 2008, theFlorida Fifth District Court of Appealheld that her statements were taken in violation of her Miranda rights, but that the search of her car was still valid under the inevitable discovery exception to the search warrant requirement because the police would have inevitably found the evidence in the normal course of the investigation, even without her illegally obtained statements. The case was sent back for trial. A pre-trial status hearing was scheduled for June 22, 2009. On April 1, 2009, the judge ordered Nowak to undergo two psychiatric evaluations before June 12, 2009.[124][125][126]
On May 15, 2009, it was reported that Nowak would notclaim insanityif her case went to trial. Nowak's attorney withdrew a previous motion filed in 2007, which would have left open the opportunity to use an insanity defense in the case.[127]On October 7, 2009, a judge in Orlando ruled in favor of allowing Nowak's attorneys to take a second deposition from Shipman to inquire whether Nowak actually pepper-sprayed Shipman. A medical report by paramedics raised some questions according to Nowak's attorneys as to the factual basis for it. If it was found not to have occurred, Nowak's attorneys wanted the criminal charges related to the assault and battery dropped before trial began. The trial was scheduled for December 7, 2009. On November 10, 2009, Nowak entered a guilty plea to felony burglary and misdemeanor battery as part of aplea deal. She was sentenced to a year's probation and the two days already served in jail, with no additional jail time.[76][128][129][130]In March 2011, Nowak petitioned the court to seal the record of her criminal proceedings, citing harm to her family and their livelihood.[131]The motion was granted.[132]

After NASA
After the incident in Orlando, the Navy insisted on Nowak and Oefelein being returned to the Navy from NASA because they had violated the Navy's rules prohibiting adultery.[133]Naval officials waited for Nowak's kidnapping case to be resolved before taking further action against her.[134]She remained on active duty with the Navy and was subsequently ordered to work on the staff of the Chief of Naval Air Training (CNATRA) atNaval Air Station Corpus Christi, Texas. There, she was involved in the development of flight training curricula for broad use throughout the Navy.[135]Nowak received theNASA Space Flight Medalon August 22, 2006, and on June 5, 2007.[136][137][138]Nowak and her husband Richard divorced in June 2008, and she was given full custody of their three children.[127][139]
ANaval Board of Inquiryconsisting ofRear AdmiralsMark S. Boensel,Eleanor V. ValentinandTimothy S. Matthewsvoted on August 19, 2010, to recommend Nowak be discharged from the Navy underother than honorable conditionsandreduced in rankfrom captain tocommander. The panel's recommendation had to be reviewed by theNaval Personnel Command, and ultimately it would be determined by theSecretary of the Navy.[140][141][142][143]On July 28, 2011,Assistant Secretary of NavyJuan M. Garcia IIIconfirmed the panel's sentence.[144]Nowak's conduct, Garcia said in a statement, "fell well short" of what is expected of Navy officers and "demonstrated a complete disregard for the well-being of a fellow service member".[145]She retired from the Navy with an other than honorable discharge and the rank of commander on September 1, 2011.[139][145]
AstronautMichael Coats, the director of the Johnson Space Center from 2005 to 2012,[146]recalled that Nowak struggled after leaving the Navy, as the notoriety of her case kept potential employers from hiring her.[133]In 2017,Peoplemagazine reported that Nowak was living quietly in Texas, where she was working in the private sector. Her attorney stated: "She's doing well."[147]

In popular culture
Many found Nowak's story fascinating, and it has been adapted for music, film, and television. "Rocket Man", a 2007 episode ofLaw & Order: Criminal Intent, was inspired in part by Nowak's story and featured a love triangle among astronauts.[148]A 2008Molly Lewissong, "Road Trip", recounts the details of early news reports about Nowak's trip from Houston to Orlando.[149]TheBen Foldssong "Cologne", from his 2008 albumWay to Normal, also mentions the incident.[150]The 2017Austramusic video for "I Love You More Than You Love Yourself" references the actions leading up to Nowak's final arrest, with bandleaderKatie Stelmanisplaying the role of Nowak.[151]Nowak was also the subject of a play,Starcrosser's Cut, which opened in Los Angeles in June 2013.[152]The 2019 filmLucy in the Sky, starringNatalie Portman, was loosely based on Nowak's story.[153]
