Hauck was involved in the search for the submarineUSSThresherwhen it sank off the coast of Cape Cod in 1963.[6]In 1964, he attended the U.S.Naval Postgraduate School,Monterey, California, for studies in mathematics and physics and for a brief time in 1965 studied the Russian language at theDefense Language Institutein Monterey. Selected for the Navy's Advanced Science Program, he received a master's degree in nuclear engineering from Massachusetts Institute of Technology the next year.
He commenced flight training at theNaval Air Station Pensacola,Florida, in 1966, and was designated aNaval Aviator, receiving hisaviator wingsin 1968.

Selected fortest pilottraining, he reported to the U.S. Naval Test Pilot School atNAS Patuxent River,Marylandin 1971. A 3-year tour in theNaval Air Test Center's Carrier Suitability Branch of the Flight Test Division followed. During this period, Hauck served as a project test pilot for automatic carrier landing systems in theRA-5 Vigilante, A-6 Intruder,A-7 Corsair II,F-4 PhantomandF-14 Tomcataircraft and was team leader for the Navy Board of Inspection and Survey aircraft carrier trials of the F-14.

In May 1989 he became director, Navy Space Systems Division, in the Office of theChief of Naval Operations. In this capacity he held budgeting responsibility for the Navy's space programs. Captain Hauck left military active duty on June 1, 1990.

NASA experience
NASA selected Hauck as an astronaut candidate in January 1978. He made an early impression on his fellow astronauts in his first days. Being one of the new TFNGs to sit at the table during his first morning astronaut meeting. Some thought he was either a fool or the most confident among the new candidates.[7]He was assistant Crimson teamCAPCOMfor thefirst Space Shuttle missionre-entry. His first spaceflight was as pilot forSTS-7, the seventh flight of theSpace Shuttle, which launched fromKennedy Space Center,Florida, on June 18, 1983. The crew includedRobert Crippen(spacecraft commander), and three mission specialists,John Fabian,Sally Ride, andNorm Thagard. This was the second flight for the orbiterChallengerand the first mission with a 5-person crew. During the mission, the STS-7 crew deployed satellites for Canada (ANIK-C2) andIndonesia(Palapa B-1); operated the Canadian-builtRemote Manipulator System(RMS) to perform the first deployment and retrieval exercise (with theShuttle Pallet Satellite(SPAS-01)); and with Crippen conducted the first piloting of the orbiter in close proximity to a free-flying satellite (SPAS-01). Mission duration was 147 hours before landing on a lakebed runway atEdwards Air Force Base,California, on June 24, 1983.
Hauck was spacecraft commander for the second mission ofDiscoveryon missionSTS-51-A, which launched on November 8, 1984. His crew includedDavid M. Walker (astronaut)(pilot), and three mission specialists,Joseph Allen,Anna Fisher, andDale Gardner. During the mission, the crew deployed two satellites, Telesat Canada'sAnik D-2, and Hughes' LEASAT-1 (SyncomIV-1). In the first space salvage mission in history, the crew also retrieved for return to Earth thePalapa B-2andWestarVI satellites. STS-51-A completed 127 orbits of the Earth before landing at Kennedy Space Center, Florida, on November 16, 1984.[8]
In March 1985 Captain Hauck became the Astronaut Office project officer for the integration of the liquid-fueledShuttle-Centaurupper-stage rocket. In May 1985 he was named commander of the Centaur-boostedUlyssessolar probemission,STS-61-F(sponsored by the European Space Agency). It was set to launch in a tight launch window in May 1986. After theChallengeraccident this mission was postponed, and the Shuttle-Centaur project was terminated.
In August 1986, Captain Hauck was appointed NASA associate administrator for external relations, the policy advisor to theNASA Administratorfor congressional, public, international, inter-governmental, and educational affairs. He resumed his astronaut duties at theJohnson Space Centerin early February 1987.
Hauck was spacecraft commander ofDiscoveryonSTS-26, the first flight to be flown after theChallengeraccident. The mission launched on September 29, 1988. The flight crew included the pilot,Richard Covey, and three mission specialists,David Hilmers,Mike Lounge, andGeorge Nelson. During the four-day mission, the crew deployed theTracking and Data Relay Satellite(TDRS-C) and operated eleven mid-deck experiments. While in command of the flight, Hauck and the rest of the crew took time to honor those lost on Challenger. Hauck offered words of honor to his fallen friends, "Dear friends, we have resumed the journey that we promised to continue for you. Dear friends, your loss has meant that we could confidently begin anew. Dear friends, your spirit and your dreams are still alive in our heart."[9]Discoverycompleted 64 orbits of the Earth before landing at Edwards Air Force Base, California, on October 3, 1988.
