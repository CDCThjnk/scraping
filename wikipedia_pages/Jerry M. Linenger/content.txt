Jerry Michael Linenger(born January 16, 1955) is a retiredCaptainin theUnited States Navy Medical Corps, and a formerNASAastronautwho flew on theSpace ShuttleandSpace StationMir.

Background
Born January 16, 1955, and raised inEast Detroit, Michigan, he is married to the former Kathryn M. Bartmann ofArlington Heights, Illinois; they have four children. Linenger graduated fromEast Detroit High School1973. He received aBachelor of Sciencedegree inbiosciencefrom theUnited States Naval Academyin 1977, adoctorateinmedicinefromWayne State University School of Medicinein 1981, aMaster of Sciencedegree insystems managementfrom theUniversity of Southern Californiain 1988, aMaster of Public Healthdegree inhealth policyfrom theUniversity of North Carolina at Chapel Hillin 1989 and aDoctor of Philosophydegree inepidemiologyfrom the University of North Carolina in 1989.

 - There is a McDonald's in Eastpointe (formerly East Detroit) that was decorated in outer space/Jerry Linenger memorabilia. There was a statue of Linenger next to the cash register. The statue was tragically removed with a remodel in 2020. The sculpture was made by Alex Walker in 2000.

Academic experience
Linenger graduated from the U.S. Naval Academy and proceeded directly tomedical school. After completing hissurgical internshiptraining atBalboa Naval Hospital,San Diego, California, andaerospace medicinetraining at the Naval Aerospace Medical Institute,Pensacola, Florida, he served as a navalflight surgeonatNaval Air Station Cubi Pointin thePhilippines. He was then assigned as medical advisor to theCommander, Naval Air Forces,U.S. Pacific Fleet, San Diego. After completing doctorate-level training inepidemiology, Linenger returned to San Diego as a research principal investigator at the Naval Health Research Center. He concurrently served as a faculty member at theUniversity of California, San Diego School of Medicinein the Division ofSports Medicine.

NASA experience
Linenger joined astronaut selectionGroup 14at theJohnson Space Centerin August 1992. He flew onSTS-64(September 9–20, 1994) aboard theSpace ShuttleDiscovery. Mission highlights included: first use oflasersforenvironmentalresearch, deployment and retrieval of a solar sciencesatellite,roboticprocessing ofsemiconductors, use of anRMS-attached boom forjetthrusterresearch, first untetheredspacewalkin 10 years to test a self-rescuejetpack. In completing his first mission, Linenger logged 10 days, 22 hours, 51 minutes in space, completed 177 orbits, and traveled over 4.5 million miles.
Following his first mission, in January 1995, he began training at theGagarin Cosmonaut Training CenterinStar City, Russia, in preparation for a long-duration stay aboard the RussianSpace StationMir.[1]All training was conducted using theRussian language, and consisted of learning all Mir space station systems (life support/electrical/communication/attitude control/computersystems),simulatortraining,Soyuzlaunch/return vehicle operations, and spacewalk water tank training. He also trained as chief scientist to conduct the entire United States science program, consisting of over one-hundred planned experiments in various disciplines. A sampling includes:medicine(humoral immunity,sleepmonitoring, radiationdosimetry),physiology(spatial orientation/performance changes during long duration flight), epidemiology (microbialsurface sampling),metallurgy(determination of metaldiffusion coefficients),oceanography/geology/limnology/physical science(photographicsurvey (over 10,000 photos) of theEarth),space science(flame propagation),microgravityscience (behavior offluids, critical angle determination).
Linenger launched aboard U.S.Space ShuttleAtlantis(STS-81) on January 12, 1997, remained on board the space station with two Russiancosmonautsupon undocking of the Shuttle, and eventually returned upon a different mission ofAtlantis(STS-84) on May 24, 1997—spending a total of 132 days, 4 hours, 1 minute in space—the longest duration flight of an American male at that time.[2]
During his stay aboard Space Station Mir, Linenger became the first American to conduct a spacewalk from a foreign space station and in a non-American madespacesuit. During the five-hour walk, he and his Russian colleague tested for the first time ever the newly designedOrlan-MRussian-built spacesuit, installed the Optical Properties Monitor (OPM) and Bentondosimeteron the outer surface of the station, and retrieved for analysis on Earth numerous externally mounted material-exposure panels.
The three crewmembers also performed a "flyaround" in the Soyuz spacecraft-undocking from one docking port of the station, manually flying to and redocking the capsule at a different location-thus making Linenger the first American to undock from a space station aboard two different spacecraft (U.S. Space Shuttle and Russian Soyuz).
While living aboard the space station, Linenger and his two Russian crewmembers faced numerous difficulties: the most severe fire ever aboard an orbiting spacecraft,[3]failures of onboard systems (oxygengenerator,carbon dioxidescrubbing, cooling line loop leaks, communication antenna tracking ability,urinecollection and processing facility), a near collision with a resupply cargo ship during a manual docking system test, loss of station electrical power, and loss of attitude control resulting in a slow, uncontrolled "tumble" through space. In spite of these challenges and added demands on their time (in order to carry out the repair work), they still accomplished all mission goals-spacewalk, flyaround, and one-hundred percent of the planned U.S. science experiments.
In completing the nearly five-month mission, Linenger logged approximately 50 million miles (the equivalent of over 110 round trips to theMoonand back), more than 2,000 orbits around the Earth, and traveled at an average speed of 18,000 miles per hour.
Linenger retired from NASA and the U.S. Navy in January 1998, and presently lives with his family in northernMichigan.[4]
