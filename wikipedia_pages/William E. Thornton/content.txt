William Edgar Thornton(April 14, 1929 – January 11, 2021) was an AmericanNASAastronaut. He received aBachelor of Sciencedegree inphysicsfromUniversity of North Carolinaand adoctorateinmedicine, also from UNC. He flew onChallengertwice, theSTS-8andSTS-51-Bmissions.

Early life and education
William Edgar Thornton was born on April 14, 1929. He attended primary and secondary schools inFaison, North Carolina. He received a bachelor of science degree in physics from theUniversity of North Carolina(UNC) in 1952.[1]In 1963, he received a doctorate in medicine from UNC.[1]

Experience
Following graduation from the University of North Carolina and having completed Air ForceROTCtraining, Thornton served as officer-in-charge of the Instrumentation Lab at the Flight Test Air Proving Ground. He later became a consultant to Air Proving Ground Command.[2]
As chief engineer of the electronics division of theDel Mar Engineering LabsatLos Angelesfrom 1956 to 1959, he also organized and directed its Avionics Division. He returned to the University of North Carolina Medical School in 1959, graduated in 1963, and completed internship training in 1964 at the Wilford Hall USAF Hospital atLackland Air Force Base,San Antonio, Texas.[2]
Thornton returned to active duty with theUnited States Air Forceand was then assigned to the USAF Aerospace Medical Division,Brooks Air Force Base, San Antonio, where he completed the Primary Flight Surgeon's training in 1964. It was during his two-year tour of duty there that he became involved in space medicine research and subsequently applied and was selected for astronaut training. Dr. Thornton developed and designed the first mass measuring devices for space, which remain in use today.[2]
Thornton has logged over 2,500 hours pilot flying time injet aircraft.[2]

NASA experience
Thornton was selected as a scientist-astronaut in August 1967[3]withNASA Astronaut Group 6. He completed the required flight training atReese Air Force Base, Texas.  Thornton was physician crew member on the highly successfulSkylab Medical Experiments Altitude Test (SMEAT)—a 56-day simulation of a Skylab mission enabling crewmen to collect medical experiments baseline data and evaluate equipment, operations, and procedures.  Thornton was also the mission specialist onSMD III, a simulation of a Spacelab life sciences mission.[2]
Thornton was a member of the astronaut support crew for theSkylab 2,3, and4missions, and principal investigator for Skylab experiments on mass measurement, anthropometric measurements,hemodynamics, and human fluid shifts and physical conditioning. He first documented the shift and loss of fluid changes in body posture size and shape, including increase in height and the rapid loss of muscle strength and mass in space flight.[2]
As a member of the Astronaut Office Operations Missions Development group, Thornton was responsible for developing crew procedures and techniques for deployable payloads, and for maintenance of crew conditions in flight. He developed advanced techniques for, and made studies in,kinesiologyandkinesimetryrelated to space operations.[2]
DuringSpace Shuttleoperations he continued physiological investigations in thecardiovascularandmusculoskeletalandneurologicalareas. He developed the Shuttle treadmill for in-flight exercise and several other on-board devices. He was long an advocate for exercise as a countermeasure for conditions such asbone loss in space.[4]His work concentrated on the space adaptation syndrome, with relevant investigations onSTS-4,STS-5,STS-6,STS-7, andSTS-8.[2]
Thornton holds more than 60 patents that range from military weapons systems through the first real-timeEKGcomputer analysis. Space-related items include the first in-flight mass measurement devices, shock and vibration isolation systems, an improved waste collection system, an improved lower body negative pressure (LBNP) apparatus, and others.[2]
Thornton continued his work in space medicine while awaiting his next flight opportunity. He worked on problems relative to extending mission durations in theSpace Shuttle, in theSpace station, and in space exploration, and has designed the necessary exercise and other hardware to support such missions. He continued analysis and publication of results from studies of neurological adaptation, and the study of neuromuscular inhibition following flight,osteoporosisin space and on Earth, and post-flightorthostatic hypotension. He has completed designs for exercise and other countermeasure equipment for the Extended Duration Orbiter (EDO), and forSpace Station Freedom, including improved treadmills, rowing machines, isotonic exercise devices, and a bicycle. Much of this is currently scheduled for flight.[2]

Spaceflight experience

STS-8
STS-8Challenger(August 30 to September 5, 1983). This was the third flight for the Challenger and the first mission with a night launch fromKennedy Space Center, Florida, and a night landing atEdwards Air Force Base, California. Thornton, participating as a scientist-astronaut, was one of five crew members.[5]During the flight Thornton made almost continuous measurements and investigations of adaptation of the human body to weightlessness, especially of the nervous system and of the space adaptation syndrome. This was a continuation of his previous work in these areas. Much of the equipment used was designed and developed by Thornton. The mission was accomplished in 98 orbits of the Earth, traveling 2.2 million miles in 145 hours, 8 minutes, 4 seconds.[6]He became the oldest person to fly in space.[5]

STS-51B
STS-51B/Spacelab-3Challenger(April 29 to May 6, 1985). The Spacelab-3 science mission was launched from Kennedy Space Center, Florida, and returned for a night landing at Edwards Air Force Base, California.[7]During the 7-day flight, Thornton was responsible for the first animal payload on a shuttle mission[1]and other medical investigations. The mission was accomplished in 110 orbits of the Earth, traveling 2.9 million miles (4.7 million km) in 169 hours and 39 minutes.[2]
At the conclusion of the STS-51B flight, Thornton had logged over 313 hours in space across his two missions.[2]

Post-NASA career
Thornton retired from NASA effective May 31, 1994.[1]Thornton was later a Clinical Assistant Professor in the Department of Medicine,University of Texas Medical Branch,Galveston, Texas, and was an adjunct professor at theUniversity of Houston–Clear Lake. He donated his NASA papers and archives to the North Carolina State Archives in 2010.[8]
