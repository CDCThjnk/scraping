Initially assigned to flight software verification in theShuttle Avionics Integration Laboratory(SAIL), Lindsey also served as the Astronaut Office representative working on theMultifunction Electronic Display System(MEDS) program, a glass cockpit Space Shuttle upgrade program, as well as a number of other advanced upgrade projects. In between his first two flights, he worked as the Shuttle Landing and Rollout representative responsible for training flight crews and testing orbiter landing techniques and flying qualities. After his second flight, Lindsey served as Deputy for Shuttle Operations and Co-Chairman of the Space Shuttle Cockpit Council, responsible for designing, testing, and implementing crew interfaces and displays for the $400 million Shuttle Cockpit Avionics Upgrade. More recently, he served as the Chief of International Space Station Operations for the astronaut office, responsible for integrating astronaut, civil service, and contractor activities in providing support to all aspects of the development, testing, crew training and operations of theInternational Space Station.

Spaceflight experience
Lindsey has flown five missions in space for NASA. He served as pilot of STS-87 (1997) and STS-95 (1998) and commander of STS-104 (2001), STS-121 (2006) and STS-133 (2011).
STS-87(November 19 to December 5, 1997) was the fourth U.S Microgravity Payload flight and focused on experiments designed to study how theweightlessenvironment ofspaceaffects various physical processes, and on observations of theSun’s outer atmospheric layers. Two members of the crew performed anEVA(spacewalk) that featured the manual capture of aSpartan satellite, and tested EVA tools and procedures for futureSpace Stationassembly. During the EVA, Lindsey piloted the first flight of theAERCam Sprint, a free-flying robotic camera. The mission was accomplished in 252 orbits of the Earth, traveling 6.5 million miles in 376 hours and 34 minutes.
STS-95(October 29 to November 7, 1998) was a 9-day mission during which the crew supported a variety of researchpayloadsincluding deployment and retrieval of the Spartan solar-observing spacecraft, theHubble Space TelescopeOrbital Systems Test Platform, and investigations on space flight and the aging process. The mission was accomplished in 134 Earth orbits, traveling 3.6 million miles in 213 hours and 44 minutes.
STS-104(July 12 to July 24, 2001), designated assembly mission 7A, was the 10th mission to the International Space Station (ISS). During the 13-day flight the crew conducted joint operations with theExpedition 2crew and performed three spacewalks to install the ISSJoint AirlockQuest and to outfit it with fourhigh-pressure gas tanks. In addition to installing and activating the Joint Airlock, the crew also performed the first spacewalk from Quest. The mission was accomplished in 200 Earth orbits.
STS-121(July 4 to July 17, 2006) was an ISS visit and space shuttle checkout mission. It was the second flight after theColumbiadisaster(STS-107) and was considered one of the two Return to Flight test missions before resumption of normal shuttle operations.  Lindsey served as mission commander on the flight.
