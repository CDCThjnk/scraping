He was engaged in fleet replacement training in theF-14 TomcatatVF-101,NAS Oceana,Virginia, from January 1984 until his selection for the astronaut candidate program.[4]
He logged over 9,000 hours flying time in 62 different types of aircraft and made 450 carrier landings, including over 350 arrested landings, and numerous tests of the Automated Carrier Landing System.[4]

NASA career
Selected as a NASA astronaut candidate in May 1984, Culbertson completed basic astronaut training in June 1985. Technical assignments since then included: member of the team that redesigned and tested theSpace Shuttlenosewheel steering, tires, and brakes; member of the launch support team atKennedy Space Centerfor Shuttle flightsSTS-61-A,STS-61-B,STS-61-C, andSTS-51-L; in 1986 he worked at the NASA Headquarters Action Center inWashington, D.C., assisting with theChallengeraccidentinvestigations conducted by NASA, thePresidential Commission, andU.S. Congress.[4]
He became lead astronaut at theShuttle Avionics Integration Laboratory(SAIL); lead of the First Emergency Egress Team; and lead spacecraft communicator (CAPCOM) in theMission Control Centerfor seven missions (STS-27,STS-29,STS-30,STS-28,STS-34,STS-33, andSTS-32[note that Shuttle missions are not ordered chronologically]). Following his first flight, he served as the Deputy Chief of the Flight Crew Operations Space Station Support Office, as well as the lead astronaut for Space Station Safety. He was also a member of the team evaluating the hardware and procedures for the proposed mission to dock with the Russian Space StationMir. FollowingSTS-51, Culbertson was Chief of the Astronaut Office Mission Support Branch; then Chief of theJohnson Space CenterRussian Projects Office.[4]
In 1994, Culbertson was named Deputy Program Manager, Phase 1 Shuttle-Mir, and in 1995 became Manager of theShuttle-Mir Program. He was responsible for a multi-national team which executed nine Shuttle docking missions to the Russian Space Station Mir, with seven astronauts spending 30 months cumulatively on board the Mir Station, plus all the associated science and docking hardware to ensure the success of the joint program, a precursor to the building of the joint International Space Station. Culbertson also spent one year as Deputy Program Manager for Operations of the International Space Station Program.[4]
Culbertson retired from NASA in August 2002 to pursue interests in private industry.[7]

Spaceflight experience
A veteran of three space flights, Culbertson has logged over 143 days inspace.[7]
STS-38Atlantis(November 15–20, 1990) was a five-day mission during which the crew conductedDepartment of Defenseoperations. The mission concluded after 80 orbits of the Earth in 117 hours, 54 minutes, 28 seconds, the first Shuttle to land in Florida since 1985.[8]
STS-51Discovery(September 12–22, 1993) was a ten-day mission during which the crew deployed the U.S.Advanced Communications Technology Satellite(ACTS/TOS), and theShuttle Pallet Satellite(ORFEUS/SPAS) carrying U.S. and German scientific experiments, including an ultraviolet spectrometer. A seven-hour EVA was also conducted to evaluateHubble Space Telescoperepair tools and methods. After the SPAS spacecraft had completed six days of free flight some 40 miles fromDiscovery, the crew completed a successful rendezvous and recovered the SPAS with the Shuttle's robot arm. The mission concluded with the first night landing of the Shuttle at the Kennedy Space Center. Mission duration was 158 Earth orbits in 236 hours and 11 minutes.[9]
TheExpedition 3crew launched on August 10, 2001, aboardSTS-105Discoveryand docked with the International Space Station on August 12, 2001. Culbertson lived and worked aboard the station for a total of 129 days, and was in command of the station for 117 days. He was the only American not to be on Earth during theSeptember 11 attacks.[10]As the ISS passed over theNew York City areaafter the attacks, Culbertson took photographs of the smoke emanating fromGround Zeroinlower Manhattan.[11][12]He later learned thatthe planethat struckthe Pentagonhad been piloted (at takeoff) by his Naval Academy classmateCharles Burlingame.  The two had been aeronautical engineering majors together, and had beenF-4fighter pilots.[13]Culbertson had his trumpet onboard ISS, and with their Academy class having their 30th reunion, he played "Taps," which he felt was especially fitting in that the two had also played in the academy's Drum & Bugle Corps together.[14]The Expedition 3 crew left the station on December 15 aboardSTS-108Endeavour, landing at Kennedy Space Center, Florida, on December 17, 2001.[15]
