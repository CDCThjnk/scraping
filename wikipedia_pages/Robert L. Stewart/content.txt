NASA career
Selected as an astronaut candidate by NASA in January 1978, Stewart became a NASA astronaut in August 1979. His technical duties in the Astronaut Office included: testing and evaluation of the entry flight control systems forSTS-1(the firstSpace Shuttleorbital mission), ascent abort procedures development, and payload coordination. He also served as support crewman forSTS-4, and Ascent/OrbitCAPCOMforSTS-5. He served as a mission specialist onSTS-41-Bin 1984 andSTS-51-Jin 1985, and logged a total of 289 hours in space, including approximately 12 hours of EVA operations.
Although astronauts who had served in theUnited States Army Air ForcesduringWorld War II(includingGus GrissomandDeke Slayton) had previously flown, Stewart was the first active-duty Army officer to make a spaceflight.
While in training for his scheduled third flight (STS-61-K, ultimately cancelled as a result of theChallengerdisaster) in 1986, Stewart was selected by the Army for promotion to brigadier general. Upon accepting this promotion, Stewart was reassigned from NASA to be the Deputy Commanding General,U.S. Army Strategic Defense Command, inHuntsville, Alabama. In this capacity, Stewart managed research efforts in developing ballistic missile defense technology. He was reassigned as Director of Plans,United States Space Command,Colorado Springs, Colorado, in 1989.

Spaceflight experience
STS-41-BChallenger(February 3–11, 1984) was launched fromKennedy Space Center,Florida, and returned to land there 8 days later. During the mission, Stewart and fellow astronaut Bruce McCandless participated in twoextravehicular activities(EVAs) to conduct first flight evaluations of the Manned Maneuvering Units (MMUs). These EVAs represented man's first untethered operations from a spacecraft in flight. Upon completion of this mission Stewart became the first Army officer awarded theArmy Astronaut Badge.
Stewart firstEVA, together withBruce McCandlesslasted 6 hours and 17 minutes. During the second EVA, Stewart used theMMUfor an untethered spacewalk, lasted 5 hours and 55 minutes.[1]
STS-51-JAtlantis(October 3–7, 1985) was launched from Kennedy Space Center, Florida, and after 98 hours of orbital operations returned to land at Edwards Air Force Base, California. It was the second Space ShuttleDepartment of Defensemission, and the maiden voyage ofAtlantis. During the mission, he was responsible for a number of on-orbit activities.[2]

Later career
Stewart retired from the Army in 1992 and made his home inWoodland Park, Colorado, for many years. He was employed as director of advanced programs at theNichols Research CorporationinColorado Springs, Colorado, before retiring. He later moved toHuntsville, Alabama, where he currently resides. He makes appearances at theU.S. Space & Rocket Center, greeting visitors and signing autographs.
