Michael James Massimino(born August 19, 1962)[1]is an Americanprofessorofmechanical engineeringatColumbia Universityand a formerNASAastronaut. He is the senior advisor of space programs at theIntrepid Sea, Air & Space Museum.

Early life
Massimino was born August 19, 1962, inOceanside, New York, and raised inFranklin Square, New York,[2]both onLong Island. He graduated fromH. Frank Carey Junior-Senior High SchoolinFranklin Square, New Yorkin 1980.[3]He went on to attendColumbia University, graduating with aBachelor of Sciencedegree inindustrial engineeringin 1984. He then attended theMassachusetts Institute of Technology, graduating with aMaster of Sciencedegree inmechanical engineeringand aMaster of Sciencedegree inTechnologyandPublic Policyin 1988.[4]He continued his education at MIT, earning aDegree of Mechanical Engineerin 1990 and aDoctor of Philosophydegree inmechanical engineeringin 1992.[4][5]

Career
Upon completing his B.S. degree from Columbia, Massimino worked forIBMas a systems engineer inNew York Cityfrom 1984 until 1986. In 1986 he entered graduate school at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology where he conducted research on human operator control of space robotics systems in the MIT Mechanical Engineering Department'shuman–machine systemsLaboratory. His work resulted in the awarding of two patents. While a student at MIT he worked during the summer of 1987 as a general engineer at NASA Headquarters in the Office of Aeronautics and Space Technology. He received an MS in Mechanical Engineering from MIT in 1988, and MS in Technology and Policy from MIT in 1988.[3]During the summers of 1988 and 1989 as a research fellow in the Man-Systems Integration Branch at theNASAMarshall Space Flight Center, and during the summer of 1990 as a visiting research engineer at theGerman Aerospace Center(DLR) inOberpfaffenhofen, Germany. He received the Degree of Mechanical Engineer from MIT in 1990, and a Ph.D. in mechanical engineering from MIT in 1992.[3]Massimino worked atMcDonnell DouglasAerospace inHouston, Texasas a research engineer where he developedlaptop computerdisplays to assist operators of theSpace Shuttleremote manipulator system. These displays included the Manipulator Position Display, which was evaluated onSTS-69. From 1992 to 1994 he was also an adjunct assistant professor in the Mechanical Engineering & Material Sciences Department atRice University, where he taught feedback control of mechanical systems. In September 1995, Massimino joined the faculty of theGeorgia Institute of Technologyas an assistant professor in the School of Industrial and Systems Engineering. At Georgia Tech he taught human-machine systems engineering classes and conducted research on human-machine interfaces for space and aircraft systems in the Center for Human-Machine Systems Research. He has published papers in technical journals and in the proceedings of technical conferences.

NASA career
Selected as anastronaut candidate by NASA in May 1996, Massimino reported to theJohnson Space Centerin August 1996. He completed two years of initial training and evaluation and qualified for flight assignment as a mission specialist. Prior to his first space flight assignment, Massimino served in the Astronaut Office Robotics Branch, and in the Astronaut Office Extravehicular Activity (EVA) Branch. He has served as aCAPCOM(spacecraft communicator) in Mission Control and performed other technical tasks in the Astronaut Office CAPCOM Branch.
On July 29, 2014, Massimino announced that he would be leaving NASA to pursue a teaching career atColumbia University, inNew York City.[4]
STS-109Columbia(March 1–12, 2002). STS-109 was the fourthHubble Space Telescope(HST) servicing mission. The crew of STS-109 successfully upgraded the Hubble Space Telescope, leaving it with a new power unit, a new camera (theAdvanced Camera for Surveys), and new solar arrays. STS-109 set a record for spacewalk time with 35 hours and 55 minutes during 5 spacewalks. Massimino performed two spacewalks totaling 14 hours and 46 minutes. STS-109 orbited the Earth 165 times, and covered 4.5 million statute miles in over 262 hours and 10 minutes.[4]
STS-125Atlantis(May 11–24, 2009) was the final Hubble servicing mission by the Space Shuttle.Atlantislanded in California after stormy weather prevented the shuttle from landing at NASA's home base in Florida as previously planned. During the mission Massimino became the first person to useTwitterin space, writing, "From orbit: Launch was awesome!! I am feeling great, working hard, & enjoying the magnificent views, the adventure of a lifetime has begun!"[6]

Post-NASA career
AtColumbia University, Massimino is teaching an undergraduate engineering course,Introduction to Human Space Flight, which harnesses his years of academic and professional experience.[7]He is also collaborating onThe Art of Engineering, a course in which all first-year engineers work on engineering projects with socially responsible themes.[8][9]
Massimino's 2016 book,Spaceman: An Astronaut's Unlikely Journey to Unlock the Secrets of the Universe, is aNew York Timesbest-seller.[10]
The street that Massimino grew up on in Franklin Square, Long Island has been renamed "Mike Massimino Street".[11]
