Career

Military
Melroy was commissioned throughAir Force ROTC, Detachment 365, in 1984. After completing a master's degree, she attended Undergraduate Pilot Training atReese Air Force Basein Lubbock, Texas and was graduated in 1985. She flew theKC-10for six years atBarksdale Air Force Basein Bossier City, Louisiana, as a copilot, aircraft commander and instructor pilot. Melroy is a veteran ofthe United States invasion of Panamaand OperationDesert Shield/Desert Storm, with over 200 combat and combat support hours. In June 1991, she attended the Air Force Test Pilot School atEdwards Air Force Base, California. Upon her graduation, she was assigned to theC-17Combined Test Force, where she served as a test pilot until her selection for the astronaut program. She has logged over 5,000 hours of flight time in over 50 different aircraft. Melroy retired from the Air Force in February 2007.

NASA
Selected as an astronaut candidate byNASAin December 1994, Melroy reported to theJohnson Space Centerin March 1995. She completed a year of training and evaluation and was qualified for flight assignment as a shuttle pilot. Initially assigned to astronaut support duties for launch and landing, she also worked Advanced Projects for the Astronaut Office. She also performed CAPCOM duties in mission control. Melroy served on theColumbiaReconstruction Team as the lead for the crew module and served as deputy project manager for theColumbiacrew survival investigation team. In her final position, she served as branch chief for the Orion branch of the Astronaut Office.
Melroy served as pilot on two flights (STS-92 in 2000 and STS-112 in 2002), and was the mission commander on STS-120 in 2007, making her the second woman to command a Space Shuttle mission (afterEileen Collins).[7]The STS-120 crew visited the station duringExpedition 16, commanded byPeggy Whitson. Whitson was the first female ISS commander, making theSTS-120mission the first time that two female mission commanders were in orbit at the same time.[8][9]
She has logged over 924 hours (over 38 days) in space.[8]
 - STS-92Discovery(October 11–24, 2000) was launched from theKennedy Space Center, Florida and returned to land at Edwards Air Force Base, California. During the 13-day flight, the seven member crew attached theZ1 Trussand Pressurized Mating Adapter 3 to theInternational Space StationusingDiscovery's robotic arm and performed four spacewalks to configure these elements. This expansion of the ISS opened the door for future assembly missions and prepared the station for its first resident crew. The STS-92 mission was accomplished in 202 orbits, traveling 5.3 million miles in 12 days, 21 hours, 40 minutes and 25 seconds.
 - STS-112Atlantis(October 7–18, 2002) launched from and returned to land at the Kennedy Space Center, Florida. STS-112 was an International Space Station assembly mission during which the crew conducted joint operations with the Expedition-5 by delivering and installing theS1 Truss(the third piece of the station's 11-piece Integrated Truss Structure). It took three spacewalks to outfit and activate the new component, during which Melroy acted as internal spacewalk choreographer. STS-112 was the first shuttle mission to use a camera on the External Tank, providing a live view of the launch to flight controllers and NASA TV viewers. The mission was accomplished in 170 orbits, traveling 4.5 million miles in 10 days, 19 hours, and 58 minutes.
 - STS-120Discovery(October 23 – November 7, 2007) launched from and returned to land at the Kennedy Space Center.[10]During the mission, theNode 2element namedHarmonywas delivered to the International Space Station. This element opened up the capability for future international laboratories to be added to the station. In addition, the P6 Solar Array was re-located from the Z1 Truss to the end of the port side of the Integrated Truss Structure. During the re-deploy of the array, the array panels snagged and were damaged. An unplanned spacewalk was successfully performed to repair the array. The mission was accomplished in 238 orbits, traveling 6.2 million miles in 15 days, 2 hours, and 23 minutes.
In November 2020, Melroy was announced as a member ofPresident-elect Joe Biden's presidential transitionAgency Review Team, where her role was to support transition efforts related to NASA. This fueled speculation that Melroy was under consideration for the role ofNASA Administratorin theBiden administration(then-AdministratorJames Bridenstinehad indicated that he did not intend to stay in the role under Biden, even if asked).[11][12]
On April 16, 2021, The White House announced their intent to nominate Melroy to be NASA's deputy administrator, under former Democratic SenatorBill Nelson, who was nominated by the White House on March 19, 2021, to be the agency's administrator.[13]On April 22, 2021, her nomination was sent to the Senate.[14]TheSenate Committee on Commerce, Science, and Transportationheld a hearing on May 20, 2021, in which Melroy won strong bipartisan support to be deputy administrator. During her hearing, Melroy expressed support for extending the lifetime of the International Space Station, and said she would work closely with Administrator Bill Nelson in running the agency.[15]
On June 16, 2021, her nomination was reported out of theSenate Commerce Committeeby voice vote, and the following day, her nomination was confirmed by the fullSenatebyunanimous consent.[16]On June 21, 2021, she was sworn into office by administratorBill Nelson.[17]

Personal life
Melroy is married to Douglas Hollett, a geologist, who was previously actingassistant secretary for fossil energyin theUnited States Department of Energyand vice president for Southeast Asia exploration atMarathon Oil.[10]
