Harrison Hagan"Jack"Schmitt(born July 3, 1935) is an Americangeologist, formerNASA astronaut,university professor, and formerU.S. senatorfromNew Mexico. He is the most recent living person—and only person without a background in military aviation—to have walked on theMoon.[3]
In December 1972, as a crewmember ofApollo 17, Schmitt became the first member ofNASA's first scientist-astronaut groupto fly in space. As Apollo 17 was the last of theApollomissions, he also became thetwelfth and second-youngest person to set foot on the Moonand the second-to-last person to step off of the Moon (he boarded theLunar Moduleshortly before commanderEugene Cernan). Schmitt also remains the only professional scientist to have flown beyondlow Earth orbitand to have visited the Moon.[4]Before training for Apollo 17, he was influential in the geology field for supporting the Apollo program and had helped train Apollo astronauts chosen to visit the lunar surface.
Schmitt resigned from NASA in August 1975 to run for election to theUnited States Senateas a member from New Mexico. As theRepublicancandidate inthe 1976 election, he defeatedDemocraticincumbentJoseph Montoya. Inthe 1982 election, Schmitt was defeated by DemocratJeff Bingaman.

Biography

Early life and education
Born July 3, 1935,[5]inSanta Rita, New Mexico, Schmitt grew up in nearbySilver City,[6]and is a graduate of theWestern High School(Class of 1953). He received aBachelor of Sciencedegree ingeologyfrom theCalifornia Institute of Technologyin 1957[7]and then spent a year studying geology at theUniversity of Osloin Norway, as a Fulbright Scholar.[6][8]He received aDoctor of Philosophyin geology fromHarvard Universityin 1964, based on his geological field studies in Norway.[6][9]

NASA career
Before joiningNASAas a member of thefirst group of scientist-astronautsin June 1965,[10]he worked at the U.S. Geological Survey's Astrogeology Center atFlagstaff, Arizona,[11]developing geological field techniques that would be used by the Apollo crews. Following his selection, Schmitt spent his first year atAir ForceUPTlearning to become a jet pilot. Upon his return to the astronaut corps in Houston, he played a key role in training Apollo crews to begeologicobservers when they were in lunar orbit and competent geologic field workers when they were on the lunar surface. After each of the landing missions, he participated in the examination and evaluation of the returned lunar samples and helped the crews with the scientific aspects of their mission reports.[12]
Schmitt spent considerable time becoming proficient in theCSMandLMsystems. In March 1970 he became the first of the scientist-astronauts to be assigned to space flight, joiningRichard F. Gordon Jr.(Commander) andVance Brand(Command Module Pilot) on theApollo 15backup crew. The flight rotation put these three in line to fly as prime crew on the third following mission, Apollo 18. WhenApollo 18 and Apollo 19 were canceledin September 1970, the community of lunargeologistssupporting Apollo felt so strongly about the need to land a professional geologist on the Moon, that they pressuredNASAto reassign Schmitt to a remaining flight. As a result, Schmitt was assigned in August 1971 to fly onApollo 17, replacingJoe Engleas Lunar Module Pilot. Schmitt landed on the Moon with commanderGene Cernanin December 1972.[13]
Schmitt claims to have taken the photograph of theEarthknown asThe Blue Marble, one of themost widely distributedphotographic images in existence.[14]His Apollo 17 crewmates,Gene Cernan(Mission Commander) andRonald Evans(Command Module Pilot), have made the same claim, and NASA's official position is to credit all three together.[15]
"Perhaps the hardest thing to get used to on the Moon is that the sky is completely black. There's no blue at all."
While on the Moon's surface, Schmitt—the only geologist in the astronaut corps—collected the rock sample designatedTroctolite 76535, which has been called "without doubt the most interesting sample returned from the Moon".[17]Among other distinctions, it is the central piece of evidence suggesting that the Moon once possessed an active magnetic field.[18]
As he returned to the Lunar Module before Cernan, Schmitt is the next-to-last person to have walked on the Moon's surface. Since the death of Cernan in 2017, Schmitt is the most recent person to have walked on the Moon who is still alive. After the completion of the Apollo 17 mission, Schmitt played an active role in documenting the Apollo geologic results and also took on the task of organizing NASA's Energy Program Office.[19]
On April 29, 2018, the Schmitt Space Communicator SC-1x named in his honor was carried aboard theBlue OriginNew Shepardcrew capsule[20][21]in a project partly funded by NASA.[22][23]It launched the first commercial two-way data andWi-Fi hotspotservice in space and sent the first commercialTwittermessage from space.[24][25]The three-pound (1.4 kg) device was developed bySolstar, which Schmitt had joined as an advisor, and launched 66 miles (106 km) above the Earth's surface, just past theedge of space, as a technology demonstration. The device was admitted to theSmithsonianNational Air and Space Museum.[26][27]

Senate career
On August 30, 1975, Schmitt retired from NASA to seek election as aRepublicanto theUnited States SenaterepresentingNew Mexicoin the1976 election.[28][29]The astronaut-politician campaigned for fourteen months, and his campaign focused on the future.[30]In the Republican primary, held on June 1, 1976, Schmitt defeated the unknown Eugene Peirce.[31]In the election, Schmitt opposed two-term Democratic incumbentJoseph Montoya.[30]He defeated Montoya 57% to 43%.[32]
He served one term and, notably, was the chairman of the Science, Technology, and Space Subcommittee of theUnited States Senate Committee on Commerce.[33]He sought a second term in1982, facing state Attorney GeneralJeff Bingaman. Bingaman criticized Schmitt for not paying enough attention to local matters; his campaign slogan asked, "What on Earth has he done for you lately?"[34]This, combined with the deep recession, proved too much for Schmitt to overcome; he was defeated, 54% to 46%.[35]

Post-Senate career
Following his Senate term, Schmitt has been a consultant in business, geology, space, and public policy. Schmitt is an adjunct professor of engineering physics at theUniversity of Wisconsin–Madison,[36]and has long been a proponent of lunar resource utilization.[37][38]In 1997 he proposed the Interlune InterMars Initiative, listing among its goals the advancement of private-sector acquisition and use of lunar resources, particularly lunarhelium-3as a fuel for notionalnuclear fusionreactors.[39]
Schmitt was chair of theNASA Advisory Council, whose mandate is to provide technical advice to the NASA Administrator, from November 2005 until his abrupt resignation on October 16, 2008.[40]In November 2008, he quit the Planetary Society over policy advocacy differences, citing the organization's statements on "focusing on Mars as the driving goal of human spaceflight" (Schmitt said that going back to the Moon would speed progress toward a crewed Mars mission), on "accelerating research into global climate change through more comprehensive Earth observations" (Schmitt voiced objections to the notion of a present "scientific consensus" on climate change as any policy guide), and on international cooperation (which he felt would retard rather than accelerate progress), among other points of divergence.[41]
Schmitt also serves as a visiting senior research scientist at theFlorida Institute for Human & Machine Cognition.[42]
In January 2011, he was appointed as secretary of theNew Mexico Energy, Minerals and Natural Resources Departmentin the cabinet of GovernorSusana Martinez, but was forced to give up the appointment the following month after refusing to submit to a required background investigation.[43]El Paso Timescalled him the "most celebrated" candidate for New Mexico energy secretary.[44]
Schmitt wrote a book entitledReturn to the Moon: Exploration, Enterprise, and Energy in the Human Settlement of Spacein 2006.[45]Schmitt is also involved in several civic projects, including the improvement of the Senator Harrison H. Schmitt Big Sky Hang Glider Park inAlbuquerque, New Mexico.[46]

Views on climate change
Schmitt hasrejectedthescientific consensus on climate change, which states that climate change is real, progressing, dangerous, and primarily human-caused. He has claimed that climate change is predominantly caused by natural factors, as opposed to human activity. Schmitt has argued that the risks posed by climate change are overstated and has instead supported the notion[47]that climate change is a "tool" used to advocate for the expansion of the government.[41]
Schmitt resigned from thePlanetary Societydue to disagreements over their "Roadmap to Space Exploration", which recommended prioritizing earlier human missions to Mars over U.S. lunar expeditions. He believed lunar exploration was crucial for Mars missions, stating, "The fastest way to get to Mars is by way of the Moon."[48]Additionally, Schmitt criticized the society's stance on global warming, writing in his resignation letter that the "'global warming scare' is being used as a political tool to increase government control over American lives, incomes and decision making," asserting it should not be part of the Society's activities.[41]Schmitt spoke at the March 2009International Conference on Climate Change, an anthropogenicclimate change denierevent[49]hosted by the conservativeHeartland Institute,[50]where he said that climate change was a "stalking horseforNational Socialism."[51]He appeared in December that year on theFox Business Network, saying that "[t]heCO2scare is ared herring".[52]
In a 2009 interview with far-right conspiracy theorist and radio hostAlex Jones, Schmitt asserted a link between the collapse of the Soviet Union and the American environmental movement: "I think the whole trend really began with the fall of the Soviet Union. Because the great champion of the opponents of liberty, namely communism, had to find some other place to go and they basically went into the environmental movement."[53]
In 2013, Schmitt co-authored an opinion column inThe Wall Street JournalwithWilliam Happer, contending that increasing levels of carbon dioxide in the atmosphere are not significantly correlated with global warming, attributing the "single-minded demonization of this natural and essential atmospheric gas" to advocates of government control of energy production. Noting a positive relationship between crop resistance to drought and increasing carbon dioxide levels, the authors argued, "Contrary to what some would have us believe, increased carbon dioxide in the atmosphere will benefit the increasing population on the planet by increasing agricultural productivity."[54]

In popular culture
 - Schmitt was portrayed byTom Amandesin the 1998 miniseriesFrom the Earth to the Moon.[55]
 - Schmitt appeared in a 1993 episode ofBill Nye the Science Guy.[56]
 - ComedianNorm Macdonaldmentioned Schmitt in his stand-up routine from at least 2015 until shortly before his death, joking about Schmitt's relative obscurity despite being one of only a few people to ever walk on the Moon.[57]
 - Schmitt was mentioned in theKing of the Hillepisode "Maid in Arlen." He was shown as a cardboard model.[58]

Awards and honors

 - AAPG's Special Award has been changed to the Harrison Schmitt Award in 2011. It recognizes individuals or organizations that, for a variety of reasons, do not qualify for other Association honors or awards. Schmitt received the award in 1973 for his contribution as the first geologist to land on the Moon and study its geology.[63]
 - 2015 Recipient of theLeif Erikson Exploration Award, awarded byThe Exploration Museum, for his scientific work on the surface of the Moon in 1972, and for his part in the geology training of all the astronauts that walked on the Moon before him.[64]
