Dirk Dries David Damiaan, Viscount Frimout(born 21 March 1941 inPoperinge, Belgium) is a Belgianastrophysicistfor theEuropean Space Agency. He flew aboard NASA Space Shuttle missionSTS-45as apayload specialist,[1]making him the first Belgian in space.[2]

Education
Elementary SchoolatPoperinge.Secondary Schoolat Koninklijk Technisch Atheneum (K.T.A) atGhent, Belgium. Received anEngineer's degreeinelectrical engineeringatUniversity of Ghentin 1963; aPhDinapplied physicsfromUniversity of Ghentin 1970; post-doctorate atUniversity of ColoradoLaboratory for Atmospheric and Space Physics[3](ESROfellow) in 1971–1972.

Career
 - 1965-1978 Belgian Institute for Space Aeronomy. As Head of Section Instrumentation, performed experiments with stratospheric balloons and sounding rockets.[3]
 - 1978-1984European Space Agency(ESA) as Crew Activities Coordinator and Experiment Coordinator for Spacelab-1.[3]
 - 1984-1989 Microgravity Division of ESTEC, responsible for sounding rocket program, parabolic flights, experiments on EURECA, reflight ofSpacelab-1experiments.[3]
Frimout flew as a payload specialist onSTS-45Atlantis (24 March to 2 April 1992). STS-45 was launched from and returned to land at theKennedy Space Center,Florida. It was the firstSpacelabmission dedicated toNASA's Mission to Planet Earth. During the nine-day flight, the crew aboard Atlantis operated the twelve experiments that constituted theATLAS-1(Atmospheric Laboratory for Applications and Science) cargo. ATLAS-1 obtained a vast array of detailed measurements of atmospheric chemical and physical properties, which contributed significantly to improving our understanding of our climate and atmosphere. In addition, this was the first time an artificial beam of electrons was used to stimulate a man-made auroral discharge.[4]At mission conclusion, Frimout had traveled 3.2 million miles in 143Earthorbitsand logged over 214 hours in space.
His flight made him instantaneously very famous in Belgium and triggered what was calledFrimout-mania.[5]Prince Philippeof Belgium talked with him when he was in space and a ticker tape parade was organized when he came back to Belgium.
Currently, Frimout is an ESA staff member. He is a senior engineer in the Payload Utilization Department of the Columbus Directorate, responsible for the ESA support to the European experiments onATLAS-1, and the Microgravity Measurement Assembly to be flown on D2.
He has authored more than 30 publications relating to Atmospheric Physics Experiments, Crew Training for Spacelab, and Microgravity Experiments.

Personal
He is married and has two children. Hobbies include running, cycling, walking, traveling, and chess.[6]

Awards and honors
 - 1971–72 Postdoctoral Research Fellow from ESRO (European Space Research Organization).
 - After his spaceflight, Frimout was ennobled and given the title ofviscountin theBelgian nobility.[6]

Organizations
 - Fellow of theRoyal Academy for Science and the Arts of Belgium, Class of Technical Sciences, since 2009.[7]
 - Associate member of the Belgian National Council for Space Research.
 - Member of K VIV (Royal Association of Flemish Engineers).
 - Association of Engineers from the University of Ghent.
