Gennady Mikhailovich Strekalov(Russian:Генна́дий Миха́йлович Стрека́лов; 26 October 1940 – 25 December 2004)[1]was an engineer,cosmonaut, and administrator at Russian aerospace firmRSC Energia. He flew into space five times and lived aboard theSalyut 6,Salyut 7, andMirspace stations, spending over 268 days in space. The catastrophic explosion of a Soyuz rocket in 1983 led to him being one of only four people to use alaunch escape system. He was decorated twice asHero of the Soviet Unionand received theAshoka Chakrafrom India.

Personal life
Strekalov was born on 26 October 1940 inMytishchinearMoscow,[2]the son of Mikhail Strekalov and his wife Praskoyva. Mikhail Strekalov was killed in 1945 while fighting for the Red Army inPoland.[3]Gennadi Strekalov graduated fromN. E. Bauman Moscow Higher Technical Schoolin 1965 with anengineer'sdiploma.[2]He married Lydia Anatolievna Telezhina; the couple had two daughters, Tatiana and Natalia.[3][2]He died in Moscow on 25 December 2004, from cancer, aged 64.[1]

Career
After leaving school, Strekalov began work as an apprentice coppersmith atOKB-1,Sergei Korolev'sexperimental design bureau, where he helped to assembleSputnik 1.[1]He left to attend university atN. E. Bauman Moscow Higher Technical School, obtaining a degree in technical science. He then returned to OKB-1 (which was later renamed RSC Energia) and worked there for the rest of his life.[2]
As part of an operations group, he participated in mission control for flights of scientific research vehicles belonging to theAcademy of Sciences.
In January 1974, he began training as a crew member for amissionaboard theSoyuz spacecraftas aflight engineerand, in 1976, was part of the backup crew for theSoyuz 22mission. Starting October 1978, he trained as a flight engineer for Soyuz expeditions toSalyut-series space stations.[2]
His first spaceflight was 27 November to 10 December 1980, as research engineer onSoyuz T-3's mission to theSalyut 6station.[2]
His next flight was to be newSalyut 7space station. He andVladimir Titovwere the backup crew for theSoyuz T-5mission, the first flight to the new station. The pair, together withAleksandr Serebrov, launched in April 1983 onSoyuz T-8. As the spacecraft separated from the aerodynamic fairing that shielded it during launch, part of itsIgla rendezvous radar systemwas damaged.[4]The crew attempted a manual docking, using only optical instruments aboard their spacecraft and guided by ground radar, but the approach was unsuccessful and Titov had to brake and dive to avoid a collision.[1][4]Having used up too much of their propellant to attempt another approach, the crew were forced to return to Earth on 22 April 1983.[1]
Strekalov and Titov were again scheduled to fly to Salyut 7 on 26 September 1983. The mission'sSoyuz-Ulauncher developed a serious fuel leak in the minutes before launch, forcing launch control to attempt to fire thelaunch escape systemto pull the spacecraft away from the rocket to safety.[5]This initially failed, but finally operated only 20 seconds before the rocket exploded, devastatingBaikonur's Site 1 pad. Strekalov and Titov's capsule was dragged (at accelerations of more than 10 G) to safety and landed 4 km (2.5 mi) from the pad, its occupants bruised but otherwise uninjured. Strekalov and Titov's narrow escape was the first ever live use of a launch escape system in the history of human spaceflight.[5]Titov and Strekalov would subsequently celebrate the anniversary of their dramatic escape, calling it their "second birthday".[1]As it did not launch, the mission is known by its technical article designationSoyuz 7K-ST No.16L; it would have beenSoyuz T-10, a codename that was instead used the following year.[1][2]
Strekalov's next spaceflight was aboardSoyuz T-11, withYuri Malyshevand Indian cosmonautRakesh Sharma. The flight launched fromBaikonur's Site 31on 3 April 1984 and, unlike Strekalov's previous two attempts, successfully docked with Salyut-7.[1][2]The crew stayed on Salyut-7 until 11 April 1984, and returned to Earth not in the spacecraft in which they had come, but in the reentry module of Soyuz T-10, which was already docked at the space station.
From 1 August to 10 December 1990, he was the flight engineer onSoyuz TM-10's flight toMir, withGennady Manakovand Japanese reporter-cosmonautToyohiro Akiyama. At 130 days, this was his longest spaceflight.[2]
After this, Strekalov formally retired and became head of the civilian section of the cosmonaut department.[1]But he returned to flight status for theShuttle–Mir Programand on 14 March 1995 he flew onSoyuz TM-21to theMirspace station, accompanied byVladimir Dezhurovand American astronautNorman Thagard. The mission, designated EO-18, was the first non-US launch to carry an American into space. Although successful, Strekalov's time onMirwas fraught - the crew undertook a number of taxing spacewalks to repair the station, culminating in a dispute when mission controllers ordered an unplanned spacewalk to repair a stuck solar array. Strekalov, believing the proposal to be too dangerous, refused to perform it, and argued with his colleagues on the ground for several days until they acquiesced. On 7 July 1995, the Soyuz TM-21 crew returned to Earth, not on the Soyuz that had brought them, but aboard USSpace ShuttleAtlantis(STS-71) which had brought their relief.[1]Overall the mission lasted 115 days. Due to Strekalov's refusal, he was fined approximately US$10,000 in pension and benefit entitlements, but he took RSC Energia to arbitration and had the fine overturned.[1][3][6]
Strekalov continued to work for RSC Energia until his death.[1]
