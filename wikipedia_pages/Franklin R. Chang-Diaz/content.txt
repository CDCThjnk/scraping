NASA career
Chang-Díaz was selected as an astronaut candidate byNASAin 1980, and first flew aboard Space Shuttle missionSTS-61-Cin 1986. Subsequent missions includedSTS-34(1989),STS-46(1992),STS-60(1994),STS-75(1996),STS-91(1998), andSTS-111(2002). During STS-111, he performed threeextravehicular activities(EVAs) withPhilippe Perrinas part of the construction of theInternational Space Station(ISS). He was also director of the Advanced Space Propulsion Laboratory at theJohnson Space Centerfrom 1993 to 2005. Chang-Díaz retired from NASA in 2005.[4]

Post-NASA career
After leaving NASA, Chang-Díaz set up theAd Astra Rocket Company, which became dedicated to the development of advancedplasma rocketpropulsion technology. Years of research and development have produced theVariable Specific Impulse Magnetoplasma Rocket(VASIMR), an electrical propulsion device for use in space.[17]With a flexible mode of operation, the rocket can achieve very high exhaust speeds, and with a sufficiently powerful electrical supply even has the theoretical capability to take a crewed rocket to Mars in 39 days.[18]
Chang-Díaz also is active inenvironmental protectionand raisingawareness about climate change, notably in his role inOdyssey 2050 The Moviein which he encourages young people to get motivated about environmental issues.[19]
In addition, he is an adjunct professor in physics and astronomy atRice University.[20]He has been on the board of directors of Cummins since December 8, 2009.[21]
He is also the father of Democratic candidate for the2022 Massachusetts gubernatorial electionSonia Chang-Díaz.

Awards and honors

He was inducted into the NASAAstronaut Hall of Fameon May 5, 2012[22]in a ceremony that took place in theKennedy Space Center Visitor Complex. Also, due to his career and scientific success, he has been decorated multiple times in Costa Rica and named Honor Citizen by thenational legislature.[7]The Costa Rican National High Technology Center (CeNAT), among other institutions, is named after him.[23]In 2014, Chang-Díaz was awarded the "Buzz AldrinQuadrennial Space Award" byThe Explorers Club.
