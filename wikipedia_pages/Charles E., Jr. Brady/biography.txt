- STS-78 launched on June 20, 1996, and landed 16 days and 21 hours later on July 7, 1996, becoming the longest Space Shuttle mission to date.

A few days later, the Houston Chronicle reported the county sheriff's statement that Brady had died of self-inflicted wounds after suffering a long illness related to arthritis. He was buried near his father in Robbins, North Carolina.
- It was not until a year later, in the context of reporting on other astronauts, that the media reported more widely that Brady had committed suicide.
