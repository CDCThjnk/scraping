NASA career
Brady was selected by NASA in March 1992 and reported to theJohnson Space Centerin August 1992. He was qualified for selection as a mission specialist on future Space Shuttle flight crews. Technical assignments included: working technical issues for the Astronaut Office Mission Development Branch; flight software testing in theShuttle Avionics Integration Laboratory(SAIL); astronaut representative to the Human Research Policy and Procedures Committee; deputy chief for Space Shuttle astronaut training; and chief for Space Station astronaut training in the Mission Operations Division. He flew onSTS-78in 1996 and logged over 405 hours, more than 16 days, in space.[1]
As an astronaut andamateur radioenthusiast, callsign N4BQW, Brady was one of the pioneers of theShuttle Amateur Radio Experiment(SAREX), and a member of theAmerican Radio Relay League.[3][4]
STS-78launched on June 20, 1996, and landed 16 days and 21 hours later on July 7, 1996, becoming the longest Space Shuttle mission to date. (Later that year theSTS-80mission broke that record by nineteen hours). The Life and Microgravity Spacelab mission served as a model for future studies on board theInternational Space Station.[4]The mission included studies sponsored by ten nations, and five space agencies, and the international crew included a Frenchman, a Canadian, a Spaniard, and an Italian.[1]
While with NASA, Brady held a number of jobs with the agency's astronaut office. He was chief of space station astronaut training before leaving to return to Navy duty, where he reached the rank of captain. He enjoyed canoeing, kayaking, tennis, biking, and amateur radio operating.

Later years
In 2000, Brady was assigned as flight surgeon toWhidbey Island Naval Air StationinWashington state. He retired from the Navy in March 2006, after suffering for years from a severe kind of arthritis.[5]He had enjoyed an active outdoor life and made several expeditions with a ham radio group to small islands in the South Pacific.
Brady died on July 23, 2006. He was survived by his fiancée, Susen Oseth, their son, Charles "Charlie" Brady III,[3]his mother Ann Brady, and sister Jery Ann Kennedy. His father was deceased. When NASA announced his death, it said he had suffered from a lengthy illness, and this was reported by most major sources.[2][6]A few days later, theHouston Chroniclereported the county sheriff's statement that Brady had died of self-inflicted wounds after suffering a long illness related to arthritis. He was buried near his father in Robbins, North Carolina.[5]
It was not until a year later, in the context of reporting on other astronauts, that the media reported more widely that Brady had committed suicide.[7][8]NASA internal emails related to Brady, which were released under theFreedom of Information Act, documented health issues and noted there was an investigation of his suicide, including interviews with family and friends.[8][9]
