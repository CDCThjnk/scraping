Edward George Gibson(born November 8, 1936) is a formerNASA astronaut,pilot,engineer, andphysicist.
Before becoming an astronaut, Gibson graduated from theUniversity of Rochesterand theCalifornia Institute of Technology. He became a research assistant injet propulsionwhile completing his studies, and eventually became a research scientist forPhilcoCorporation until joining NASA in 1965. Gibson is the last surviving crew member ofSkylab 4.
Gibson was selected as part ofNASA Astronaut Group 4, the first group of scientist-astronauts. He served on the support crew ofApollo 12, the second Moon landing mission, before working on the development of theSkylabspace station. In 1973–74, Gibson made his only flight into space as science pilot aboardSkylab 4, the third and final crewed flight to Skylab. He, along with CommanderGerald Carrand PilotWilliam Pogue, spent just over 84 days in space.
Gibson resigned from NASA in December 1974, but returned in 1977 to preside over the selection of scientist-astronaut candidates. Gibson retired from NASA for the last time in October 1982.[1]: 336

Early life and education
Gibson was born inBuffalo, New York, on November 8, 1936.[1]: 62From ages 2 to 8, Gibson battledosteomyelitis—soft spots in bones—and spent many months in and out of hospitals. Newly-availablepenicillincured the disease. To strengthen his leg that was nearly amputated, Gibson took up sports: swimming, football, and track. He primarily used swimming to strengthen his leg.[2][3]He was active in theBoy Scouts of America. He earned the rank ofFirst Class.[4]
Gibson graduated fromKenmore Senior High SchoolinKenmore, New York, in 1955, and earned aBachelor of Sciencedegree inengineeringfrom theUniversity of Rochesterin June 1959.[3]At the University of Rochester, Gibson became a member of theTheta Chifraternity. He received aMaster of Sciencedegree in engineering (jet propulsionoption) from theCalifornia Institute of Technology(Caltech) in June 1960 and aPhDin engineering with a minor inphysicsfrom Caltech in June 1964.[3]He was supervised byMaria Wonenburger.

Early career
While studying at Caltech, Gibson was a research assistant in the field ofjet propulsionand classicalphysics. His technical publications are in the fields ofplasma physicsandsolar physics. He was senior research scientist with the Applied Research Laboratories of thePhilcoCorporation atNewport Beach, California, from June 1964 until moving to NASA.[5]While at Philco, he did research inlasersand theoptical breakdownof gases.[6]
Gibson has logged more than 4,300 hours flying time—2,270 hours injet aircraft.[6]

NASA career
Gibson was selected as ascientist-astronautby NASA in June 1965.[7]He completed a 53-week course in flight training atWilliams Air Force Base,Arizona, and earned hisAir Forcewings. Since then, he has flownhelicoptersand theT-38.[6]
He served as a member of the astronaut support crew and as aCAPCOMfor theApollo 12lunar landing,[8]becoming the first from the scientist-astronaut group to get a crew assignment of any kind. He also participated in the design and testing of many elements of theSkylabspace station.[6]As part of his preparation for the Skylab program, Gibson studiedsolar physics, ultimately writing an introductory monograph/textbook   on solarastrophysicsThe Quiet Sun,[9][10]apart from 1973 English edition published in the United States there was 1977Russianedition of this book, published in theSoviet UnionbyMir Publishers.[11]

Skylab 4
Gibson was the science pilot ofSkylab 4.[12]The third and final crewed visit to the Skylab space station, it launched November 16, 1973, and concluded February 8, 1974.[13]This was the longest crewed flight (84 days 1 hour 15 minutes) in the history of crewed space exploration at that time. Gibson was accompanied on the record-setting 34.5-million-mile flight by CommanderGerald P. Carrand PilotWilliam R. Pogue.[13]They successfully completed 56 experiments, 26 science demonstrations, 15 subsystem detailed objectives, and 13 student investigations during their 1,214 revolutions of theEarth.[14]They also acquired a wide variety of Earth resources observations data using Skylab's Earth resources experiment package camera andsensor array.[15]Dr. Gibson was the crewman primarily responsible for the 338 hours of Apollo Telescope Mount operation, which made extensive observations of solar processes.[16]
Until the Soviet Union's Soyuz 26 broke the record in March 1978, Gibson and his Skylab 4 teammates held the world record for individual time in space: 2,017 hours 15 minutes 32 seconds.[15][17]Gibson logged 15 hours and 22 minutes in threeEVAsoutside the Skylab Orbital Workshop.[6]Gibson is the last surviving Skylab 4 crew member (Carr died in 2020, and Pogue died in 2014).
Gibson resigned from NASA in December 1974 to do research on Skylab solar physics data as a senior staff scientist with the Aerospace Corporation ofLos Angeles, California. Beginning in March 1976, he served for one year as a consultant to ERNO Raumfahrttechnik GmbH, inWest Germany, on Spacelab design under the sponsorship of a U.S. Senior Scientist Award form theAlexander von Humboldt Foundation. In March 1977, Gibson returned to theAstronaut Officeastronaut candidate selection and training as Chief of the Scientist-Astronaut Candidates. During his second tenure at NASA, Gibson had hoped to fly on another space station mission due to his experience on Skylab, but at the same time was not keen on flying aSpace Shuttlemission. He served as CAPCOM for STS-1.[1]: 513Gibson ultimately decided to retire from NASA again on October 31, 1982.[1]: 336

Post-NASA career
From July 1980 to August 1987, Gibson worked forTRWas a project manager atSpace Parkin support ofSpace Station Freedom.[18][19]
In October 1990, Gibson began his own consulting firm, Gibson International Corp. The firm provides consulting services on program management, market development and space infrastructure design and operations.[6]
He has performed a significant amount of speaking and writing, and published a text book in solar physics, two novels,Reach(1989)[20]andIn the Wrong Hands(1992),[21]and editedThe Greatest Adventure, a 1994 compilation of stories and pictures on space missions from many astronauts and cosmonauts around the world.[22]
He is the author of Space: Ever Farther, Ever Faster, a book reflecting on the history of space exploration and his experiences aboard Skylab 4 which was published byBook Publishers LLCin 2025.

Special honors and awards
Gibson was awarded aNational Science FoundationFellowship and the R.C. Baker Fellowship at the California Institute of Technology. He received theJohnson Space CenterCertificate of Commendation (1970).[6]He received the City ofNew YorkGold Medal (1974).[6]Gibson, along with the rest of the Skylab astronauts, received the City of Chicago Gold Medal in 1974.[23]Gibson received the 1974 FAIYuri Gagarin Gold Medal.[24]In 1976, he received the U.S. Scientist Prize from theAlexander von Humboldt Foundation, which provided funds to research in West Germany for a year.[25]He received the JSC Special Achievement Award in 1978.[6]Gibson has also been presented withhonorarydoctorates of science from the University of Rochester andWagner CollegeinNew York City, both in 1974.[6]
The three Skylab astronaut crews were awarded the 1973Robert J. Collier Trophy"For proving beyond question the value of man in future explorations of space and the production of data of benefit to all the people on Earth."[26][27]In 1974, President Nixon presented the Skylab 4 crew with theNASA Distinguished Service Medal.[28]TheAmerican Astronautical Society's 1975 Flight Achievement Award was awarded to the Skylab 4 crew.[29][30]Federation Aeronautique Internationaleawarded the Skylab 4 crew theDe La Vaulx MedalandV. M. KomarovDiploma for 1974.[31]Carr accepted the 1975Dr. Robert H. Goddard Memorial Trophyfrom President Ford, awarded to the Skylab astronauts.[32]The Skylab 4 crew won theAIAAHaley Astronautics Award in 1975 "For demonstrated outstanding courage and skill during their record-breaking 84-day Skylab mission".[33]He was one of 24 Apollo astronauts who were inducted into theU.S. Astronaut Hall of Famein 1997.[34][35]

Personal life
Gibson is married to Julianne Volk ofTonawanda, New York. He has four children: Jannet Lynn (born November 9, 1960), John Edward (born May 2, 1964), Julie Ann (born October 12, 1968), and Joseph Michael (born July 11, 1971).[36][37]

Media appearances
In the 1998HBOminiseriesFrom the Earth to the Moon, Gibson was played by actor Geoffrey Nauffts.[38]As his character serves as Capcom for Apollo 12 regardless of actual shift changes, it can be argued that he is acomposite characterof Gibson,Gerald Carr, andDon Lind.
