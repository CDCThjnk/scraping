Expedition 51/52
Originally assigned to the Expedition 52/53 crew, he was reassigned to launch aboardSoyuz MS-04to the ISS in April 2017 as a flight engineer forExpedition 51/52.[5]
Fischer launched aboard MS-04 on April 20, 2017. They docked with the station approximately 6 hours after launch, being the first crew of a Soyuz-MS series to make the shorter 6 hour rendezvous instead of the 2 day orbital rendezvous of the previous launches.
On May 13, 2017, Fischer performed his first career EVA withPeggy Whitson. The EVA was shortened due to an issue ahead of the spacewalk where the spacewalkers had to share a SCU (Service Cooling Unit) line after the umbilical for Fischer's EMU suffered from a leak. His suit was in good shape, but the line could not be used. The impact on the EMU battery life meant the full EVA duration couldn't be conducted. They replaced an avionics box on the starboard truss called an ExPRESS Logistics Carrier (ELC), a storage platform. The duration was 4 hours and 13 minutes, and it was the 200th EVA to be performed on the ISS.[6]
On May 23, 2017, Fischer performed his second EVA with Whitson. They replaced a backup multiplexer-demultiplexer (MDM) unit that had failed on May 20, 2017. The duration was 2 hours and 46 minutes.[7]
Fischer returned to Earth along withPeggy WhitsonandFyodor YurchikhinaboardSoyuz MS-04on September 3, 2017.[8]The overall duration of his stay in space was 135 days, 18 hours and 8 minutes.[1]
