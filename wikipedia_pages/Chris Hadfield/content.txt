He attended high school inOakvilleandMiltoninsouthern Ontario, and earned hisglider pilot licenceas a member of theRoyal Canadian Air Cadets. After enlisting in the Canadian Armed Forces, he earned an engineering degree at theRoyal Military CollegeinKingston, Ontario. Hadfield learned to fly various types of aircraft in the military and eventually became atest pilot, flying several experimental planes. As part of an exchange program with theUnited States NavyandUnited States Air Force, he obtained a master's degree in aviation systems at theUniversity of Tennessee Space Institute.
In 1992, Hadfield was accepted into theCanadian astronaut programby theCanadian Space Agency. He first flew in space in November 1995 as a mission specialist aboardSTS-74, visiting the Russian space stationMir. He flew again in April 2001 onSTS-100, when he visited the ISS and walked in space to help installCanadarm2. In December 2012, he flew for a third time aboardSoyuz TMA-07Mto joinExpedition 34on the ISS. When Expedition 34 ended in March 2013, Hadfield became the commander of the ISS as part ofExpedition 35, responsible for a crew of five astronauts and helping to run dozens of scientific experiments dealing with the impact of low gravity on human biology. During this mission, he chronicled life onboard the space station by taking pictures ofEarthand posting them on various social media platforms. He was a guest on television news and talk shows and gained popularity by playing the ISS's guitar in space. Hadfield returned to Earth in May 2013, when the mission ended. He announced his retirement shortly after returning, capping a 35-year-long career as a military pilot and astronaut.

Astronaut career
Hadfield was selected to become one of four new Canadian astronauts from a field of 5,330 applicants in June 1992. Three of those four (Dafydd Williams,Julie Payetteand Hadfield) have flown in space. The fourth candidate,Michael McKay, resigned as an astronaut in 1995.[15]Hadfield was assigned by the CSA to theNASAJohnson Space CenterinHouston, Texas in August, where he addressed technical and safety issues for Shuttle Operations Development, contributed to the development of theglass shuttle cockpit, and supported shuttle launches at theKennedy Space Center, in Florida.

In June 2013, one month after completing his third trip to space, Hadfield announced his retirement from the Canadian Space Agency, effective July 3, 2013.[21]Hadfield stated that after living primarily in the United States since the 1980s for his career, he would be moving back to Canada, "making good on a promise I made my wife nearly 30 years ago—that yes, eventually, we would be moving back to Canada."[21]He noted that he plans to pursue private interests outside government there.[21]
Hadfield is enthusiastic about the prospects for a crewed mission to Mars, and when asked in 2011 if he would consider being the first to visit even if the journey to Mars were one-way, he said "I would be honoured to be given the opportunity."[22]

STS-74
Hadfield served as mission specialist 1 on STS-74 in November 1995. It was NASA's second space shuttle mission to rendezvous and dock with the Russian Space StationMir. During the flight, the crew ofSpace ShuttleAtlantisattached a five-tonne docking module toMirand transferred over 1,000 kg of food, water, and scientific supplies to the cosmonauts. Hadfield flew as the first Canadian to operate theCanadarmin orbit, and the only Canadian ever to boardMir.[7]

In April 2001, Hadfield served as mission specialist 1 on STS-100, International Space Station (ISS) assembly Flight 6A. The crew ofSpace ShuttleEndeavourdelivered and installedCanadarm2, the new Canadian-built robotic arm, as well as the Italian-made resupply moduleRaffaello. During the 11-day flight, Hadfield performed two spacewalks, which made him the first Canadian to ever leave a spacecraft and float freely in space. During his first spacewalk Hadfield experienced severe eye irritation due to the anti-fog solution used to polish his spacesuit visor, temporarily blinding him and forcing him to vent oxygen into space. In total, Hadfield spent 14 hours, 50 minutes outside, travelling 10 times around the world during his spacewalk.[7][23]
