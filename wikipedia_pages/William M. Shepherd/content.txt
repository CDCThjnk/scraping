William McMichael "Bill" Shepherd(born July 26, 1949), (Capt,USN, Ret.), is an American formerNavy SEAL,aerospace,ocean, andmechanical engineer, andNASAastronaut, who served as commander ofExpedition 1,[1]the first crew on theInternational Space Station. He is a recipient of theCongressional Space Medal of Honor.[2]

Education and training
Shepherd was born on July 26, 1949, to George R. Shepherd and Barbara Shepherd inOak Ridge, Tennessee, but he considersBabylon, New York, his hometown.[1]He is married to Beth Stringham ofBatavia, New York.[3]He graduated fromArcadia High SchoolinPhoenix, Arizonain 1967, and received aBachelor of Sciencedegree inAerospace Engineeringfrom theUnited States Naval AcademyinAnnapolis, Marylandin 1971.[4]He completedBasic Underwater Demolition/SEAL (BUD/S)training in 1972, then joined theUnited States Naval Special Warfare Commandand qualified as aNavy SEAL. He served with the Navy's Underwater Demolition Team ELEVEN, SEAL Teams ONE and TWO, and Special Boat Unit TWENTY. He obtained anEngineer's degreeinOcean Engineeringand aMaster of Sciencedegree inMechanical Engineering, both in 1978, from theMassachusetts Institute of Technology(MIT).[1][4]

NASA career
When I was little I used to cut up two-by-fours and make little boats. I'm still in the boat-building business. It's just in orbit.
After Shepherd was selected forNASA Astronaut Group 10in 1984,[6]rumors spread that he had answered a standard interview question about what he did best by saying, "kill people with knives"[7]but he later refused to confirm or deny the account, commenting "it's too good a story".[8]He was the first military non-aviator in astronaut training, following his unsuccessful application forNASA Astronaut Group 9in 1980.[9]In 1986, Shepherd's Navy SEAL training proved unexpectedly useful toNASAas he helped to direct the underwater salvage operations of theSpace ShuttleChallengerafter itsdestruction. Shepherd then served as amission specialiston threeSpace Shuttleflights: missionSTS-27in 1988,[10]missionSTS-41in 1990,[11]which deployed theUlyssesprobe, and missionSTS-52in 1992.[12]He was the first member ofNASA Astronaut Group 10to fly a space mission.
From March 1993 to January 1996, he was assigned to theInternational Space Station Program,[4]serving as Program Manager and Deputy Program Manager. In November 1995 he was selected to command the first crew of the International Space Station (ISS). The mission was supposed to launch in 1997,[13]but a long series of political, financial, and technical problems caused significant delays. Although sixteen nations would participate in the ISS program, Russia, along with the United States would bear the majority of the station's costs.[5]

Spaceflight experience
STS-27:Atlantis(December 2–6, 1988) Shepherd served with his crewmates on a mission that lasted 105 hours and carriedDepartment of Defensepayloads. The mission is noteworthy due to the severe damageAtlantissustained to its critical heat-resistant tiles during ascent.[14][15][10]
STS-41:Discovery(October 6–10, 1990) during 66 orbits of theEarth, the crew aboard the Orbiter successfully deployed theUlysses, starting it on a four-year journey (viaJupiter) to investigate the polar regions of theSun.[11][16]
STS-52:Columbia(October 22 to November 1, 1992) was the 10-day mission deployed theLaser Geodynamic Satellite(LAGEOS), and conducted U.S. microgravity payload experiments.[17][12]
Expedition 1: From October 31, 2000,[18]to March 21, 2001,[19]he and RussiancosmonautsYuri GidzenkoandSergey Krikalevlaunched from Baikonur on Soyuz TM 31 and served asExpedition 1, the first crew on board ISS.  The crew returned to Earth on the Space Shuttle Discovery, STS 102.[19]
Shepherd has logged over 159 days inspace.[1]

Post-NASA career
Shepherd was next assigned to the staff of Commander,Naval Special Warfare Command,[5]to assist with the development of new capabilities and programs for the Navy's SEAL and Special Boat units. He retired from the U.S. Navy in January 2002.[5]CAPT Shepherd also served as U.S. Special Operations Command's first Science Advisor from 2008–2011.[20]
