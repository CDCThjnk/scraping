Richard Noel "Dick" Richards(born August 24, 1946), (Capt,USN, Ret.), is a retired Americannaval officerandaviator,test pilot,chemical engineer, and a formerNASAastronaut. He flew aboard fourSpace Shuttlemissions in the 1980s and 1990s.

Early life and education
He was born on August 24, 1946, inKey West, Florida, but considersHouston, Texas, to be his hometown. He is married to the former Lois Hollabaugh ofAmarillo, Texas. He graduated from Riverview Gardens High School inSt. Louis, Missouri, in 1964. He received aBachelor of Sciencedegree inchemical engineeringfrom theUniversity of Missouriin 1969, and aMaster of Sciencedegree inaeronautical systemsfrom theUniversity of West Floridain 1970. While at the University of Missouri, he became a member of theLambda Chi Alphafraternity.[1]

Military service
Richards was commissioned as anEnsignin theUnited States Navyupon graduating from the University of Missouri in 1969 and was designated aNaval Aviatorin August of the following year. From 1970 to 1973, he flew support missions in theA-4 SkyhawkandF-4 Phantomairplanes while assigned to Tactical Electronic Warfare Squadron 33 (VAQ-33) atNorfolk Naval Air Station,Virginia. He subsequently reported to Fighter Squadron 103 (VF-103), and deployed to theNorth AtlanticandMediterraneanaboard theaircraft carriersUSSAmericaandUSSSaratoga, flying F-4 airplanes. Selected for test pilot training, he reported to theU.S. Naval Test Pilot SchoolatNAS Patuxent River,Maryland, in 1976. A tour in theNaval Air Test Center's Carrier Systems Branch and F/A-18A Program Office of the Strike Aircraft Test Directorate followed Test Pilot School graduation. Over the next3+1⁄2years, Richards served as a projecttest pilotfor automatic carrier landing systems development work in F-4 andA-7aircraft and also conducted approach/landing/catapult flying qualities and catapult minimum end speed performance testing of a prototype "slatted" F-4S airplane. As carrier suitability project officer for theF/A-18A Hornetairplane, he made the first shipboard catapults and arrested landings during Initial Sea Trials of the F/A-18A on board USSAmericain 1979. He was reassigned to Fighter Squadron 33 (VF-33) in May 1980 and wasen routeto that assignment when notified of his selection as an astronaut candidate.

NASA career
Selected as an astronaut candidate byNASAin May 1980, Richards became an astronaut in August 1981. He served as ascent CAPCOM forSTS-51F, passing up the "Abort ATO" call whenChallenger'scentre engine went down.[2]Richards flew on four missions:STS-28(August 8–13, 1989),STS-41(October 6–10, 1990),STS-50(June 25 – July 9, 1992), andSTS-64(September 9–20, 1994)--and logged a total of 33 days, 21 hours, 32 minutes, 15 seconds in space. In April 1995, Richards left theAstronaut Office, and was assigned to the Space Shuttle Program Office at theJohnson Space Center. He was designated as the Mission Director/Manager for the secondHubble Space TelescopeServicing Space Shuttle Mission (STS-82), and Mission Manager for the second Tethered Satellite System Space Shuttle mission (STS-75).

Spaceflight experience
On his first space flight, Richards was pilot on the crew ofSTS-28aboard theSpace ShuttleColumbia, which launched fromKennedy Space Center,Florida, on August 8, 1989. The mission carriedDepartment of Defensepayloads and a number of secondary payloads. After 80 orbits of the Earth, this five-day mission concluded with a dry lakebed landing on Runway 17 atEdwards Air Force Base,California, on August 13, 1989. Mission duration was 121 hours 9 seconds.[3]
Slightly more than one year later, Richards commanded the crew ofSTS-41. The five-man crew launched aboard theSpace ShuttleDiscoveryon October 6 from the Kennedy Space Center, Florida, and landed at Edwards Air Force Base, California, on October 10, 1990. During 66 orbits of the Earth, the STS-41 crew successfully deployed theUlyssesspacecraft, starting this interplanetary probe on its four-year journey, viaJupiter, to investigate the polar regions of theSun.[3]
In June 1992, Richards commanded the crew ofSTS-50aboard the Space ShuttleColumbia. STS-50 was the first flight of theUnited States Microgravity Laboratoryand the first extended duration Orbiter flight. Over a two-week period, the STS-50 flight crew conducted a wide variety of experiments relating to materials processing and fluid physics in a microgravity environment. At that time this was the longest Space Shuttle flight in history.[3]
In September 1994, Richards commanded theSTS-64crew aboard the Space ShuttleDiscovery. Mission highlights included: the first use of a space based laser for environmental research; deployment and retrieval of a spacecraft in support ofsolar windandcoronastudies; robotic processing of semiconductors; maneuvered therobotic armin proximity to over 100 Shuttle reaction control system jet firings to measure forces imparted to a plume detection instrument in support of future Space Station/Shuttle rendezvous flights; first untethered spacewalk in 10 years to test a self-rescue jetpack. Mission duration was 10 days, 22 hours, 51 minutes.[3]

Post-NASA career
In August 1998, Richards left NASA to join theBoeing Company. Between 1998 and 2007 he supported NASA via Boeing's Space Shuttle Sustaining Engineering Support Contract. Boeing has over 1,000 employees across the United States involved with Space Shuttle flight operations. In 2007, Richards retired from Boeing as the Deputy Program Manager for Space Shuttle, and now lives in Houston, Texas.
