Kathryn Ryan Cordell Thornton(born August 17, 1952) is an American scientist and a formerNASAastronautwith over 975 hours in space, including 21 hours of extravehicular activity.[1]She was the associate dean for graduate programs at theUniversity of VirginiaSchool of Engineering and Applied Science, currently a professor of mechanical and aerospace engineering.[2]
Thornton was inducted in theUnited States Astronaut Hall of Famein 2010.

Education and organizations
Kathyrn Thornton graduated fromSidney Lanier High SchoolinMontgomery, Alabamain 1970. She later received aB.S.degree inphysicsatAuburn Universityin 1974. In 1977 received anM.S.degree in physics and in 1979 aPh.D.degree in physics at theUniversity of Virginia.[1]
Thornton is also a member of theAmerican Physical Society, theAmerican Association for the Advancement of Science, and the following honor societies:Sigma Pi Sigma,Phi Kappa Phi, andSigma Xi.[1]

Career

Physicist
After Thornton earned her doctoral degree at the University of Virginia in 1979, she was awarded aNATOPostdoctoral Fellowship to continue her research at theMax Planck Institute for Nuclear PhysicsinHeidelberg, Germany.[3]
In 1980, Thornton became a physicist at theUnited States Army Foreign Science and Technology CenterinCharlottesville, Virginia.[3]

NASA
Selected byNASAin May 1984,[4]Thornton became an astronaut in July 1985. Her technical assignments have included flight software verification in the Shuttle Avionics Integration Laboratory (SAIL), serving as a team member of the Vehicle Integration Test Team (VITT) atKennedy Space Center, and as a spacecraft communicator (CAPCOM).[5]A veteran of four space flights, Thornton flew onSTS-33in 1989,STS-49in 1992,STS-61in 1993, andSTS-73in 1995. She has logged over 975 hours in space, including more than 21 hours of extravehicular activity (EVA).[1]
Thornton was amission specialiston the crew of STS-33[6]: 53which launched at night from Kennedy Space Center, Florida, on November 22, 1989, aboard theSpace ShuttleDiscovery. The mission carriedDepartment of Defensepayloads and other secondary payloads. After 79 orbits of the Earth, this five-day mission concluded on November 27, 1989, atEdwards Air Force Base,California.[7]
On her second flight, Thornton served on the crew of STS-49, May 7 – 16, 1992, on board the maiden flight of the newSpace ShuttleEndeavour.[2]During the mission the crew conducted the initial test flight ofEndeavour, performed a record four EVA's (spacewalks) to retrieve, repair and deploy the International Telecommunications Satellite (Intelsat), and to demonstrate and evaluate numerous EVA tasks to be used for the assembly ofSpace Station Freedom. Thornton was one of two EVA crew members who evaluated Space Station assembly techniques on the fourth EVA. STS-49 logged 213 hours in space and 141 Earth orbits prior to landing at Edwards Air Force Base, California.[8]
On her third flight, Thornton was a mission specialist EVA crew member aboard the Space ShuttleEndeavouron the STS-61[6]: 88–89Hubble Space Telescope(HST) servicing and repair mission. STS-61 launched at night from the Kennedy Space Center, Florida, on December 2, 1993. During the 11-day flight, the HST was captured and restored to full capacity through a record five spacewalks by four astronauts, including Thornton. After having traveled 4,433,772 miles in 163 orbits of the Earth, the crew ofEndeavourreturned to a night landing at the Kennedy Space Center on December 13, 1993.[9]Then, afterExpedition 14,Sunita Williamssurpassed her for woman with the most spacewalks.[10]
From October 20 to November 5, 1995, Thornton served aboardSpace ShuttleColumbiaon STS-73,[6]: 105as the payload commander of the secondUnited States Microgravity Laboratorymission. The mission focused on materials science, biotechnology, combustion science, the physics of fluids, and numerous scientific experiments housed in the pressurized Spacelab module. In completing her fourth space flight, Thornton orbited the Earth 256 times, traveled over 6 million miles, and logged a total of 15 days, 21 hours, 52 minutes and 21 seconds in space.[11]
Thornton left NASA on August 1, 1996.[12]
She was inducted into the 2010 class of theU.S. Astronaut Hall of Fame.[13]

Leadership
Thornton is a Director Emeritus of the Space Foundation’s Board of Directors, having joined the organization in 2010 and serving in various capacities, including as Chairwoman from 2020 to 2022.[14]
In November 2020, Thornton appeared atWomenTech Network's Women in Tech Global Awards. During her appearance, she shared her experiences as a scientist and astronaut, aiming to support and inspire women in the technology sector.[15]
