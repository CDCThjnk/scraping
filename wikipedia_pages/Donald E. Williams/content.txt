He reported next for A-7 refresher training, and was assigned to Attack Squadron 94 (VA-94) when he was selected as an astronaut candidate by NASA.
He logged more than 6,000 hours of flying time, which includes 5,700 hours injetsand 745 carrier landings.[1]

Selected byNASAin January 1978, Williams became an astronaut in August 1979, qualified for assignment as a pilot on futureSpace Shuttleflight crews. He then had various support assignments, including working at theShuttle Avionics Integration Laboratory(SAIL) as a test pilot, and at theKennedy Space Centerparticipating in orbiter test, checkout, launch and landing operations.
From September 1982 through July 1983, he was assigned as the Deputy Manager, Operations Integration, National Space Transportation System Program Office at theJohnson Space Center. From July 1985 through August 1986, Williams was the Deputy Chief of the Aircraft Operations Division at the Johnson Space Center, and from September 1986 through December 1988, he served as Chief of the Mission Support Branch within the Astronaut Office.

STS-51-DDiscovery(April 12–19, 1985) was launched from and returned to land at the Kennedy Space Center, Florida. During the mission, the crew deployedANIK-CforTelesat Canada, andSyncomIV-3 for the U.S. Navy. A malfunction in the Syncom spacecraft resulted in the first unscheduledEVA,rendezvousand proximity operations for the Space Shuttle in an attempt to activate the satellite. Additionally, the crew also conducted several medical experiments, two student experiments, activated twoGetaway Specials, and filmed experiments with toys in space, including a two-minute sequence where Williams was the first person tojugglein micro-gravity.[2]The mission was accomplished in 109 orbits of the Earth in 167 hours, 54 minutes.
STS-34Atlantis(October 18–23, 1989) was launched from Kennedy Space Center, Florida and returned to land atEdwards Air Force Base, California. During the mission the crew successfully deployed theGalileospacecraft, starting its journey to exploreJupiter, operated the Shuttle Solar Backscatter Ultraviolet Instrument (SSBUV) to mapatmospheric ozone, and performed numerous secondary experiments involvingradiationmeasurements, polymermorphology,lightningresearch,microgravityeffects onplants, and a student experiment onice crystalgrowth in space. The mission was accomplished in 79 orbits of the Earth in 119 hours, 41 minutes.

Post-NASA career
In March 1990, Williams retired from the U.S. Navy asCaptain, and left NASA.[3]He joinedScience Applications International Corporation(SAIC), working on several projects in theHoustonarea, nationally, and internationally.  In April 2006, Williams retired from SAIC.[4]
