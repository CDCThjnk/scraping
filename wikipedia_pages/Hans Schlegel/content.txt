Hans was to perform a spacewalk on the first EVA (EVA1) of STS-122, on Sunday, 10 February 2008, in preparation for attaching the Columbus laboratory to the ISS. The EVA was postponed until Monday 11 February 2008 due to an undisclosed medical issue allegedly affecting Schlegel.Stanley G. Loveperformed the spacewalk instead of Schlegel.  However, Schlegel did perform the second EVA on Wednesday 13 February 2008.
