Dale Allan Gardner(November 8, 1948 – February 19, 2014) was aNASAastronaut, andnaval flight officerwho flew twoSpace Shuttlemissions during the mid 1980s.

Personal information
Born on November 8, 1948, inFairmont, Minnesota, Gardner grew up inSherburn, Minnesota, andSavanna, Illinois. He considered his hometown to beClinton, Iowa, where his mother, Alice Gardner, resides. He lived with his second wife Sherry inGolden, Coloradoand later in Divide, Colorado until his death.[1]An avid sports enthusiast, he enjoyedsnow skiing,golfing,tennis,woodworkingandphotography.

Education
Gardner graduated asvaledictorianof his class from Savanna Community High School, inSavanna, Illinois, in 1966. He received aBachelor of Sciencedegree inEngineering Physicsfrom theUniversity of Illinois at Urbana-Champaignin 1970.

Military experience
Upon graduation from theUniversity of Illinoisin 1970, Gardner entered into active duty with theUnited States Navyand was assigned to theAviation Officer Candidate SchoolatPensacola, Florida. He was commissioned anEnsignand was selected as the most promising naval officer from his class. In October 1970 he began BasicNaval Flight Officertraining with theVT-10squadron at Pensacola, graduating with the highest academic average ever achieved in the history of the squadron. He proceeded to the Naval Air Technical Training Center atNAS Glynco, Georgia, for Advanced Naval Flight Officer training and was selected a Distinguished Naval Graduate and awarded hisNaval Flight Officer wingson May 5, 1971. At theNaval Air Test CenteratNAS Patuxent River,Maryland, from May 1971 to July 1973, he was assigned to the Weapons Systems Test Division and involved in initialF-14 Tomcatdevelopmental test and evaluation as Project Officer for Inertial Navigation and Avionics Systems. Gardner's next assignment was with the first operational F-14 squadron (VF-1) atNaval Air Station Miramar,California, from where he flew in the Tomcat and participated in twoWestern PacificandIndian Oceancruises while deployed aboard the aircraft carrierUSSEnterprise. From December 1976 until July 1978, he was assigned to Test and Evaluation Squadron 4 (VX-4) aboardNAS Point Mugu, California, involved in the operational test and evaluation of Navy fighter aircraft.

NASA experience
Gardner was selected as an astronaut candidate by NASA in January 1978, reporting to theJohnson Space Centerin July 1978. In August 1979 he completed a one-year training and evaluation period, making him eligible for assignment as a Mission Specialist Astronaut. He subsequently served as the Astronaut Project Manager for the flight software in the Space Shuttle onboard computers leading up to thefirst flightin April 1981. He then served as a Support Crew Astronaut for the fourth flight (STS-4). He flew as a mission specialist onSTS-8(August 30 to September 5, 1983) andSTS-51-A(November 8–16, 1984). Gardner logged a total of 337 hours in space and 225 orbits of theEarthon these two flights.
He logged more than 2,300 hours flying time in over 20 different types of aircraft and spacecraft. Prior to theChallengeraccident, Gardner was chosen to be a member of the first Shuttlemissionto launch fromVandenberg Air Force Base,California. That flight and the Vandenberg launch capability itself were canceled after the accident.
In October 1986, following 8½ years with NASA, Gardner returned to hisNavyduties and was assigned to theU.S. Space Command,Colorado Springs, Colorado. He served over two years as the Deputy Chief, Space Control Operations Division inCheyenne Mountain Air Force Stationand, after promotion to the rank ofcaptainin June 1989, became the Command's Deputy Director for Space Control atPeterson Air Force Base. His space control responsibilities included the surveillance and tracking of all man-made objects in Earth orbit and the protection of U.S. and allied space systems. Gardner retired from the U.S. Navy in October 1990 and accepted a position withTRW Inc.in Colorado Springs, being placed as a program manager in the Colorado Springs Engineering Operations of TRW's Space and Defense Sector. In that capacity, he was involved in the development of both civilian and military space and defense high technology programs. After TRW, he became the manager ofNorthrop Grumman's operations in Colorado Springs.[1]Gardner became the Associate Director for Renewable Fuels Science and Technology at theNational Renewable Energy Laboratoryin 2003, and retired in January 2013.

Space flight experience
STS-8launched from theKennedy Space Center,Floridaon August 30, 1983. The crew aboardSpace ShuttleChallengerincludedRichard Truly(Spacecraft Commander),Daniel Brandenstein(Pilot), and fellow Mission SpecialistsGuion BlufordandWilliam Thornton. This was the third flight of the OrbiterChallengerand the first night launch and landing mission of the Shuttle program. During the flight, the crew of STS-8 deployed the Indian National Satellite (INSAT-1B), operated and tested the Canadian-builtRemote Manipulator System(RMS) robot arm, and performed numerous earth resources and space science experiments. STS-8 completed 98 Earth orbits in 145 hours before landing atEdwards Air Force Base, California on September 5, 1983.
STS-51-A, the fourteenth flight of the Shuttle program, launched on November 8, 1984 (his birthday). The crew aboardSpace ShuttleDiscoveryincludedFrederick Hauck(Spacecraft Commander),David Walker(Pilot), and fellow Mission SpecialistsJoseph AllenandAnna Fisher. This was the second flight ofDiscovery. During this mission the crew deployed two satellites, Canada'sAnik D-2(TELESAT-H) and the Hughes' LEASAT-1 (SyncomIV-1), now in service with the U.S. Navy. In an unprecedented salvage effort, they rendezvoused with and returned from space two satellites previously launched into improper orbits, the IndonesianPalapa B-2and the Western UnionWestar VIcommunication satellites. Gardner and Allen used theManned Maneuvering Unit(MMU) backpack to travel through space, completely untethered from the shuttle, for a total of 12 hours flight time. It was the first and only untethered spacewalk for returning malfunctioning satellites from orbit. The feat is exceptional: the MMU has been retired, modern astronauts rely on tethered spacewalks, and safer robotic solutions are already being developed.[2]

Organizations
Gardner was a Member ofPhi Eta Sigma,Sigma Tau, andTau Beta Pi, and a fellow of theAmerican Astronautical Society.

Special honors
Gardner was awarded theDefense Superior Service Medal(1984, 1989, 1990); theDistinguished Flying Cross(1989); theMeritorious Unit Commendation(1976);  theHumanitarian Service Medal(1979) and theSea Service Deployment Ribbon(1984). His other honors included theNASA Space Flight Medal(1983 and 1984); theMaster Space Badge(1989); and theLloyd's of LondonMeritorious Service Medal (1984).
A bridge connectingSavanna, Illinois&Sabula, Iowaover theMississippi Riverwas built through interstate collaboration in dedication to Dale Gardner and USVeteransin November 2017 as theDale Gardner Veterans Memorial Bridge.[3]This new $80.6 million bridge was constructed as a replacement to the 86 year oldSavanna-Sabula Bridge.

Death
Gardner died on February 19, 2014, after suffering ahemorrhagicstrokeat his home. He was 65.[4][5]
