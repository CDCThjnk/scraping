In 1977 Furrer applied for selection as an astronaut for the firstSpacelabmission. He made it into the final round of candidates, althoughUlf Merboldwas finally selected. In 1982, the astronauts for the first German Spacelab mission were selected from the finalists for the first mission, and Furrer was one of the two chosen. He was a payload specialist onSTS-61-A(D1), which was launched on 30 October 1985. The other payload specialists on the flight wereErnst MesserschmidandWubbo Ockels(Netherlands).

Furrer was an avid pilot. He earned his pilot license in 1974, doing several long-distance trips with one engine planes - including a flight over the inland ice ofGreenlandin 1979 and a solo flight from Germany toQuito,Ecuadorin 1981. His love for planes finally cost him his life, as he died in a plane crash after a flight show on theJohannisthal Air Field(Berlin). He was a passenger of pilot Gerd Kahdemann in a historicBf 108when the plane crashed shortly after 6:00 p.m. after performing a roll at low altitude. Both Kahdemann and Furrer were killed instantly.
