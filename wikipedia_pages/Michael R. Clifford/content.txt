Michael Richard Clifford(October 13, 1952 – December 28, 2021) was aUnited States Armyofficer andNASAastronaut. Clifford was aMaster Army Aviatorand logged over 3,400 hours flying in a wide variety of fixed and rotary winged aircraft. He retired from the U.S. Army at the rank oflieutenant colonel. He logged six hours ofspacewalktime over threeSpace Shuttlemissions. He was also one of the first people to conduct a spacewalk while docked to an orbiting space station: that spacewalk was conducted duringSTS-76, while docked at the Russian space stationMir.

Early life and education
He was born inSan Bernardino, California, on October 13, 1952,[2]the son of Lenore (née Chaffin) and her first husband John Michael Uram. His mother subsequently married Gordon Clifford.[3][4]Rich Clifford graduated fromBen Lomond High SchoolinOgden, Utah, in 1970.[5][6]He was aFirst Class Scoutin theBoy Scouts of America.[7]As a youngster, he worked in a gas station using degreasers to clean car engines as well as on a farm.[8]
Clifford received aBachelor of Sciencedegree from theUnited States Military Academy(USMA) atWest Point, New York, in 1974,[9]and aMaster of Sciencedegree inAerospace Engineeringfrom theGeorgia Institute of Technologyin 1982.[2][10]

Army career
Clifford graduated from West Point in June 1974 and was commissioned as asecond lieutenantin theU.S. Army.[1]He served a tour with the10th CavalryinFort Carson, Colorado.[1]At theU.S. Army Aviation School, he was the top graduate of his flight class and was designated anArmy Aviatorin 1976.[2]He was subsequently assigned for three years as a service platoon commander with the Attack Troop,2nd Armored Cavalry RegimentinNuremberg,West Germany.[1]After completing his graduate training in 1982, he was assigned to the USMA Department of Mechanics as an instructor and assistant professor.[1]In December 1986, he graduated from theU.S. Naval Test Pilot Schooland was designated anexperimental test pilot.[1]As a Master Army Aviator, he accumulated more than 3,400 flight hours.[11]In 1995, Clifford retired from the U.S. Army with the rank oflieutenant colonel.[2]

NASA career
As a military officer, Clifford was assigned to theJohnson Space Centerin July 1987.[1]As a Space Shuttle Vehicle Integration engineer, his duties involved engineering liaison for launch and landing operations of theSpace Shuttle Program; he was involved in design certification and integration of the Shuttle Crew Escape System, and was an executive board member of the Solid Rocket Booster Postflight Assessment Team.[12]Clifford was selected to joinNASA Astronaut Group 13in July 1990.[13]He also served in a variety of technical assignments. From April to August 1991, Clifford was assigned to the Astronaut Office Mission Development Branch where he participated in the design, development, and evaluation of Shuttle payloads and crew equipment havingextravehicular activity(EVA) interfaces.[1]From May 1994 to September 1995, he served as lead for space station vehicle/assembly issues.[1]A veteran of three space flights, Clifford flew as a mission specialist onSTS-53in 1992,[14]STS-59in 1994,[15]andSTS-76in 1996.[16]He has logged 665 hours in space, including a 6-hour spacewalk.[11][17]

STS-53
Flying on the crew ofSTS-53which launched from theKennedy Space Center,Florida, on December 2, 1992, aboard theSpace ShuttleDiscovery,[14]Clifford became the first member of his 1990 astronaut class.NASA Astronaut Group 13, to reach space.[4]On this mission, he was responsible for a number of experiments, including the Fluid Acquisition and Resupply Experiment (FARE) which he performed withGuion BlufordandJim Voss[18]He also conducted the Battlefield Laser Acquisition Sensor Test (BLAST) on a novel laser energy detector for the U.S. military.[19][20]After 116 orbits of the Earth, Clifford returned with the rest of the STS-53 crew, which landed atEdwards Air Force Base,California, on December 9, 1992.[14]

STS-59
For his next spaceflight, he served aboardSpace ShuttleEndeavouron theSTS-59Space Radar Laboratory (SRL) mission, which launched on April 9, 1994.[15]In this mission, Clifford and five other astronauts worked around the clock on imaging projects using SRLimaging radars, includingSpaceborne Imaging Radar,Synthetic-aperture radar, and acarbon monoxide(CO) sensor known as Measurement of Air Pollution from Satellites (MAPS), to collect data on the Earth's surface and atmosphere.[21][22]The mission concluded on April 20, 1994, with a landing at Edwards Air Force Base after orbiting the Earth 183 times.[15]
He was diagnosed withParkinson's diseasea few months after STS-59 by NASA medical staff and Dr.Joseph Jankovic, a neurologist in Houston. At the time, symptoms were mild and limited to the right arm, which was not swinging naturally.[23][24]

STS-76
Despite the Parkinson's diagnosis,[23]Clifford was selected to serve aboardSpace ShuttleAtlantisonSTS-76, which launched on March 22, 1996. While docked at the Russian space stationMir,  Clifford performed a six-hour spacewalk with fellow astronautLinda M. Godwinto mount experiment packages on theMirdocking module.[16]This was the first spacewalk ever conducted by a NASA crew while a Space Shuttle is docked to an orbiting space station.[11][25]Prior to the spacewalk, he woke up to music composed by his two sons.[26]Following 145 orbits of the Earth, he returned asAtlantislanded at Edwards Air Force Base in California on March 31, 1996.[16]
After the STS-76 mission, Clifford decided that he should not fly, because he did not know how fast the Parkinson's disease was going to progress.[27]

Post-NASA career
Clifford resigned from the astronaut corps and left NASA in January 1997[2]to joinBoeing's Defense and Space Group as flight operations manager for theInternational Space StationProgram.[28]He later oversaw Boeing's shuttle program till it was winding down.[29]After about 13 years, he left Boeing in September 2011.[23]

Honors
He received theDefense Superior Service Medal, theLegion of Merit, theDefense Meritorious Service Medal, theArmy Commendation Medal,National Defense Service Medalwith bronze star device,Army Service Ribbon, theNational Intelligence Medal of Achievementand theNASA Space Flight Medal.[1]He was a member of theAssociation of Space Explorers.[30][31]He received the Award for Public Leadership in Neurology from theAmerican Academy of Neurologyin 2012.[23][32]

Personal life and death
Clifford married Nancy Elizabeth Brunson ofDarlington, South Carolina; they had two sons.[2]The Cliffords took up residence inNorth Myrtle Beach, South Carolinain 2012 and Rich lived there till his death in 2021.[29]According to his wife Nancy, their first granddaughter was "named Eva, which stands forextra vehicular activity. That's his spacewalk".[29]
He was diagnosed with Parkinson's disease in 1994 when he was 42 years old.[23]He suspected that exposures to pesticides used in farms and other chemicals used on car engines since he was a youngster contributed to the early onset of his illness.[8]After retirement from his space career in 1997, he became an advocate for Parkinson's disease awareness and encouraged other patients of the disease to live life to its fullest.[33]Filmmaker Zach Jankovic, son of Dr. Joseph Jankovic who helped diagnose Clifford, made a documentary detailing Clifford's experiences with the disease; the short film entitledThe Astronaut's Secretwon the American Academy of Neurology Foundation's 2012 annual "Neuro Film Festival" competition[34]and was released in 2014.[35][36]
Clifford died from complications of Parkinson's on December 28, 2021, at the age of 69.[2][4][11][29][37]

RetrievedJanuary 4,2022.As a youngster, Mr. Clifford said, he worked in a gas station using degreasers to clean car engines. He also worked on a farm where he used pesticides and in fields where DDT was sprayed. Then, as an aviator, he cleaned engines readying them for test flights. But at none of these jobs was he protected from exposure to hazardous chemicals that are readily inhaled or absorbed through the skin. Now Mr. Clifford, a lifelong nonsmoker, believes that his close contact with these various substances explains why he developed Parkinson's disease at such a young age. Several of the chemicals have strong links to Parkinson's, and a growing body of evidence suggests that exposure to them may very well account for the dramatic rise in the diagnosis of Parkinson's in recent decades.
