Spaceflight experience

Soyuz TM-19
On July 1, 1994, Malenchenko andTalgat Musabayevlifted off to space on board theSoyuz TM-19spacecraft with Malenchenko in command of the Soyuz. Following a two-day solo flight the Soyuz docked with Mir on July 3, 1994. Main goal of the mission was the partly exchange of the resident crew. Malenchenko, Musabayev and cosmonautValeri Polyakovbecame the 16th resident Mir crew, with Malenchenko in command. The crew conducted medical experiments and experiments in materials science. There were many problems during the mission, which finally ended with the first successful manual docking of aProgresssupply ship at Mir by Malenchenko. On November 4, 1994, Malenchenko, Musabayev andUlf Merboldreturned to Earth aboard their Soyuz capsule after landing 88 km northeast ofArkalyk. Aboard Soyuz TM-19 and Mir complex Malenchenko spent 125 days, 22 hours, 53 minutes in space.[6]

STS-106
Malenchenko served as a mission specialist for STS-106.[7]Space ShuttleAtlantislifted off from theKennedy Space Center(KSC) on September 8, 2000. On flight day two,Atlantiscompleted a successful rendezvous and docking with the ISS. The objectives of the mission were to bring supplies to the International Space Station (ISS) and to prepare theZvezdaService Module for the arrival ofthe first resident crew. During the 12-day mission, the shuttle crew spent a week inside the ISS unloading supplies from both a doubleSPACEHABcargo module in the rear ofAtlantis'scargo bay and fromProgress M1-3which was docked to the aft docking port ofZvezda. After circling the globe for 186 orbits,Atlantislanded on September 19, 2000, at Runway 15, KSC. The mission lasted 11 days, 19 hours and 12 minutes.

Expedition 7
Malenchenko with astronautEdward Lulifted on board theSoyuz TMA-2spacecraft from theBaikonur Cosmodromeon April 26, 2003, to the ISS. The spacecraft docked with the ISS on April 28, 2003. Malenchenko served as the Soyuz commander, and after docking with the ISS they exchanged with the resident crew on board ISS and became the seventh station crew,Expedition 7.[8]He was the commander of the Expedition 7, and during his stay on the station, Malenchenko became the first person to get married in space. Soyuz TMA-2 returned to Earth on October 28, with both the Expedition 7 crew as well asPedro Duqueon board. The spacecraft landed at 02:40 UTC near Arkalyk. Aboard Soyuz TMA-2 and the ISS, Malenchenko spent 184 days, 22 hours and 46 minutes in space.

Expedition 16
Malenchenko with NASA astronautPeggy Whitsonand Malaysian spaceflight participantSheikh Muszaphar Shukorblasted off to space on October 10, 2007, onSoyuz TMA-11from the Baikonour Cosmodrome. He served as the Soyuz commander. The Soyuz spacecraft docked with the ISS after 2 days of autonomous flight on October 12, 2007.[9]Malenchenko joined the ISSExpedition 16crew as flight engineer 1. The Soyuz capsule landed inKazakhstanon April 19, 2008, bringing back Malenchenko, Whitson and South Korean spaceflight participantYi So-Yeon. Similar toSoyuz TMA-1andSoyuz TMA-10, Soyuz TMA-11 performed aballistic reentry, a reentry steeper than a normal reentry, due to a malfunction and landed 475 km from intended landing point, north of Arkalyk.[10]Although the crew were recovered with no injuries, the spacecraft's hatch and antenna suffered burn damage during the unusual reentry.
He accumulated 191 days, 19 hours and 8 minutes time in space during Soyuz TMA-11 and ISS Expedition 16 missions.

Expedition 32/33

Spacewalks
Malenchenko conducted his first and second career spacewalks during the Mir-16 mission. He and Musabayev performed two spacewalks on September 9, 1994 (5h 06m) and September 14, 1994, in which the station's external insulation was repaired. The first and second spacewalks lasted 5 hours and 6 minutes, and 6 hours and 1 minute respectively.
Malenchenko performed his third career spacewalk during the STS-106 mission to the ISS.[11]On flight day three, Malenchenko and NASA astronaut Ed Lu conducted a 6-hour and 14 minute space walk. The spacewalk started at 04:55 GMT on September 11 when the two spacewalkers exited the shuttle's airlock.[12]The spacewalk's objective focused on routing and connecting nine power, data and communications cables between theZvezdamodule and theZaryamodule, as well as installing the six-foot-long magnetometer to the ISS to serve as a compass showing the space station in respect to the Earth. This spacewalk marked the sixth spacewalk in support of the ISS assembly and the 50th spacewalk in space shuttle history.[13]
On November 9, 2007, Malenchenko performed his fourth career spacewalk.[14]He and Expedition 16 commander, Peggy Whitson, in USEMUsventured into space from the station'sQuestairlock at 09:54 UTC.[15]Malenchenko's suit was all white, and the purpose of the spacewalk was to prepare for the relocation ofPressurized Mating Adapter(PMA-2) and the subsequent move of theHarmonynode to its permanent location. As the first task, the two spacewalkers disconnected theStation to Shuttle Power Transfer System(SSPTS) cables between theDestinylaboratory and PMA-2. Next they disconnected eight other cables between PMA-2 and theDestiny. Malenchenko removed and replaced a failed electrical circuit box and together with Whitson removed the activeCommon Berthing Mechanismcover that was located at the outboard end ofHarmony. Next, Malenchenko moved back behind the Z1 truss to reconfigure a power system, removing an electrical jumper. The spacewalk ended at 16.49 UTC when the two spacewalkers returned to the ISS. The spacewalk lasted 6 hours and 55 minutes.
On 20 August 2012, Malenchenko together with cosmonautGennady Padalkaparticipated in his fifth career spacewalk.[16]Tasks assigned to the two cosmonauts included hardware relocations, installations, retrievals, and deployments. For the spacewalk, Malenchenko donned an Orlan spacesuit with the blue stripe. The duration of the spacewalk was 5 hours and 51 minutes. The spacewalk was delayed for about an hour due to a small leak between Space Station modules. The spacewalk started from the Pirs Docking Compartment Module at 15:37 GMT. The first task for Padalka and Malenchenko was to relocate the Strela-2 boom from the Pirs module to the forward end of the Zarya module. The relocation was needed since Pirs module will be detached from the Space Station in the future for the arrival of the new Multi-purpose Laboratory Module (MLM)Nauka. The next task completed by Padalka and Malenchenko was to deploy a 21-inch diameter spherical satellite. The two cosmonauts also  retrieved five debris shields from the Pirs Module, prior to installing them on the Zvezda Module. They also completed several get-ahead tasks (since they both opted not to take rests during the night passes) as the duo were about an hour ahead of the timeline. They retrieved an external experiment called Biorisk from the Pirs Module for return to Earth, and  for added stability installed two structural support struts between the Pirs Module and the EVA ladder. Padalka and Malenchenko then both ingress the Pirs Module, prior to closing the hatch and beginning the re-pressurisation procedure, to end a highly successful spacewalk.

Expedition 46/47
Malenchenko arrived at the ISSSoyuz TMA-19Mto join the Expedition 46 crew. He performed a manual docking due to a malfunction in the automatic docking system.Progress MS-1was then scheduled for launch to the ISS, atop aSoyuz 2.1a, on 21 December. Planned for a launch date of no earlier than 7 February 2016,[17]theSpaceX CRS-8mission provided the ISS with theBigelow Expandable Activity Module. TwoEVAswere performed during Expedition 46.[18]He returned to Earth onSoyuz TMA-19M, and landed on 18 June 2016 09:15 UTC,[19]after spending additional 186 days in space.[20]

Personal life
Malenchenko married Ekaterina (Kat) Dmietrieva on August 10, 2003. They have one child.

Wedding
Malenchenko became the first person tomarry in space, joining by video from theInternational Space Stationas Kat walked down the aisle. The wedding on Earth took place at theJohnson Space Centerin Texas, where law permits marriage with one party present. Kat called the romance a "celestial, soulful connection".[21]
Despite initial resistance, Russian officials eventually approved of the space wedding, though air force chiefVladimir Mikhailovreportedly said "a cosmonaut mustn't behave like a movie star."[21]
Malenchenko's parents were confused. His mother said, "What is this needed for — a sensation for the whole world?" according to his father, who appeared on the Russian TV channelRossiya.[22]
