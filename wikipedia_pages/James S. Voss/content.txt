James Shelton Voss(born March 3, 1949) is a retiredUnited States ArmycolonelandNASAastronaut. During his time with NASA, Voss flew in space five times on board theSpace ShuttleandInternational Space Station. He also served as deputy of Flight Operations for the Space Station Program Mission Integration and Operations Office.
He was a Scholar in Residence at theUniversity of Coloradountil his retirement in May 2025.

Early life and education
Voss was born on March 3, 1949, inCordova, Alabama, and was raised by his grandparents inOpelika, Alabama. As a child he read a lot ofscience fictionwith an emphasis onspaceflight.[1]While attendingOpelika High Schoolhe participated inwrestling,track and field, andfootball.
After graduating high school, Voss attendedAuburn University. As an undergraduate, he wrestled on the Auburn Universitywrestlingteam.  He was also a member of Beta Zeta chapter of theTheta Xifraternity, where he served as Chapter President for the school year 1970–71. While at Auburn, Voss also participated inArmy ROTC. After graduating with aBachelor of Sciencedegree inAerospace Engineeringin 1972 he was commissioned as asecond lieutenantin the U.S. Army. Under the Army Graduate Fellowship Program, Voss was allowed to defer his entry into active duty in order to attend theUniversity of Colorado. He graduated in 1974 with aMaster of Sciencedegree in Aerospace Engineering Sciences.

Army career
After receiving his master's degree, Voss attended theInfantry Basic Coursein 1974 where he was listed as a Distinguished Graduate. He then attendedAirborne SchoolandRanger School, at the latter he was awarded the Honor Graduate and Leadership Award. Voss was then stationed with the 2nd Battalion,48th Infantry RegimentinWest Germanyserving as a platoon leader, intelligence staff officer, and C company commander. He returned to the United States and attended the Infantry Officer Advanced Course in 1979, making the Commandant's List. He taught in the Department of Mechanics at theUnited States Military AcademyatWest Point. While at West Point, Voss participated in a NASA Summer Faculty Research Fellowship and received the William P. Clements Jr. Award for Excellence in Education as the outstanding professor at the Academy. Voss then attended theU.S. Naval Test Pilot School, graduating with the Outstanding Student Award in 1983. He then attended theArmed Forces Staff College. Voss was subsequently assigned as aFlight Test Engineer/Research and Development Coordinator with the U.S. Army Aviation Engineering Flight Activity. He participated in major flight test programs before being assigned toNASA. At NASA, Voss worked at the Johnson Space Center from November 1984 to June 1987. He worked as a Vehicle Integration Test Engineer supporting theSTS-51-D,STS-51-F,STS-61-C, andSTS-51-Lmissions. After theChallengeraccident, Voss participated in the investigation. He was selected by NASA as an astronaut candidate in June 1987.[2]

Astronaut career
Selected as an astronaut candidate by NASA in June 1987, Voss completed a one-year training and evaluation program in August 1988, which qualified him for assignment as amission specialistonSpace Shuttleflights. He has worked as a flight crew representative in the area of Shuttle safety, as aCAPCOM, providing a communications interface between ground controllers and flight crews during simulations and Shuttle flights, and as the Astronaut Office Training Officer. After his third spaceflight, Voss spent two years training at theYuri Gagarin Cosmonaut Training CenterinStar City, Russia. He served as a backup toMichael Foaleon theSTS-84/Mir 23/Mir 24/STS-86mission and toAndrew Thomasfor theSTS-89/Mir24/Mir 25/STS-91mission. After his fifth flight, Voss served as the Deputy for Flight Operations in the Space Station Program Mission Integration and Operations Office.[3]

Spaceflight experience
Voss was a mission specialist on boardSpace ShuttleAtlantisduringSTS-44from November 24 – December 1, 1991. The mission's primary objective was the deployment of aDefense Support Programsatellite with an Inertial Upper Stage booster rocket. The crew also conducted two Military Man in Space experiments, three radiation monitoring experiments, and numerous medical tests to support longer duration spaceflight. The mission orbited the Earth 110 times before returning toEdwards Air Force BaseinCalifornia.[4]
From December 2–9, 1992, Voss flew as a mission specialist onSTS-53. The 171 orbit flight of the Space ShuttleDiscoverydeployed a classifiedDepartment of Defensepayload. The satellite was the second launch of aSatellite Data System-2 military communications satellite.[5]
DuringSTS-69, Voss was a mission specialist and payload commander on board Space ShuttleEndeavour. The flight, which orbited the Earth 171 times from September 7–18, 1995, successfully deployed a SPARTAN satellite and the Wake Shield Facility. Also on board was theInternational Extreme Ultraviolet HitchhikerPayload as well as various medical experiments. Voss andMichael Gernhardtperformed a six-hourspacewalkin order to test space suit modifications and to evaluate tools and procedures for future use on theInternational Space Station.[6]
Voss was a mission specialist on board Space ShuttleAtlantisonSTS-101. The Shuttle visited the then-unmanned International Space Station and delivered over 3,000 pounds of equipment and supplies. The crew also repaired the Station's electrical and environmental control systems. At the time of the flight Jim was already assigned to fly onExpedition 2. His crewmatesYuri UsachevandSusan Helmsflew with him onAtlantisin order to gain experience for their future long-duration stay. Jim andJeff Williamsconducted a six-hour spacewalk to finish installation of a Russian crane, replace a faulty antenna, and install handrails on the outside of the station.[7]
Voss and hisExpedition 2crewmates launched as Mission Specialists March 8, 2001, on board Space ShuttleDiscoveryduring theSTS-102mission. The primary objectives of the flight were to rotate crew members and to resupply the station using theMulti-Purpose Logistics Module. Voss participated in one of the missions two spacewalks, along withSusan Helms, to prepare a Pressurized Mating Adapter for relocation. The spacewalk set a record of 8 hours 56 minutes duration, that withstood until, it was broken by two Chinese astronauts on 17 December 2024.[8]
Voss,Susan Helms, andYuri Usachevspent 163 days aboard theInternational Space Stationconducting 18 scientific experiments, maintenance, and outfitting. During the flight, Jim (who was a Flight Engineer) was the first person to operate the Space Station Robotic Manipulator System (Canadarm2). He also participated in a 19-minute EVA, in which Voss and Usachev prepared a docking probe for the arrival of thePirs Docking Compartment. During Jim's stay on the ISS, the space station was visited by two unmanned cargo vehicles, theSoyuz TM-32taxi mission, as well as two Space Shuttles (STS-100andSTS-104). Voss was also on board to witness the arrival of theQuest Airlock. He was one of the cinematographers and featured astronauts of the first3D filmshot in space,Space Station 3D. The film was released in theaters in 2002 and on DVD in 2005.
Voss returned home from his fifth spaceflight as a mission specialist on board the Space ShuttleDiscoveryon August 20, 2001 (STS-105). The mission saw a crew rotation, two spacewalks, and another flight of the MPLM.[9]

Post-NASA career
After retiring from NASA in 2003, Voss became Associate Dean of Engineering for External Affairs at Auburn University, assisting with student projects and development for the College and teaching a class in Aerospace Engineering on human spacecraft design. While at Auburn he led a team of twelve aerospace engineering seniors and one graduate research assistant in the development of a crew seat prototype for space startupTransformational Space CorporationArchived2020-02-25 at theWayback Machine, or t/Space. In 2005, Voss became VP of Space Exploration Systems for t/Space. In November 2007 Voss left t/Space to become the Vice President of Engineering atSpaceDev.  After SpaceDev was acquired by Sierra Nevada Corporation he becameSierra Nevada Corporation's director of advanced programs, and then VP of Space Exploration Systems and program executive on theDream Chaserspaceplane. In August 2009 Voss began teaching as a Scholar in Residence at the University of Colorado at Boulder[10]teaching a class on human spaceflight.
He retired from SNC in July 2013 and from teaching at the University of Colorado in May 2025[11]. Voss is a member of the NASA Advisory Council and on the Board of Directors of the National Space Biomedical Research Institute.
