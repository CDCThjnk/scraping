Career
Zholobov joined the space programme from theSoviet Air Forcewhere he held the rank of Colonel-engineer.
His only trip to space involved a two-month stay on theSalyut 5space station(Soyuz 21mission). The flight was scheduled to last for 60 days but lasted for only 49. The reason for the cancellation was the detection of a noxious odor on board. Zholobov reported to the Mission Control Center that the smell was similar to that of a propellant which was known to be toxic. The Control Center decided to abort the mission to avoid exposing the crew to further risk and because the research and technology programs were already successfully finished. He was in orbit from 6 June 1976 to 24 August 1976.[1]
Although he never flew again, Zholobov stayed in the space programme until 1981 when he resigned to become director of ageological scienceresearch group.
