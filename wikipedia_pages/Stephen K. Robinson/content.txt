Stephen Kern "Steve" Robinson(born October 26, 1955) is an American formerNASAastronaut.

Education
He was active in theBoy Scouts of America, where he achieved its second-highest rank,Life Scout.  Robinson graduated fromCampolindo High School,Moraga, California, in 1973, and obtained aBachelor of Sciencedegree inmechanicalandaeronautical engineeringfrom theUniversity of California, Davis, in 1978, aMaster of Sciencedegree in Mechanical Engineering fromStanford Universityin 1985; and adoctoratein mechanical engineering, with a minor inaeronauticsandastronauticsfrom Stanford University in 1990.

Organizations
Robinson is a member of theAmerican Institute of Aeronautics and Astronautics, the Aerospace Medical Association, and theExperimental Aircraft Association.

Awards and honors
He was awarded the NASAAmesHonor Award for Scientists in 1989, the American Institute of Aeronautics and Astronautics OutstandingTechnical paperAward for AppliedAerodynamicsin  1992, and the NASA/Space ClubG. M. LowMemorialEngineeringFellowship in 1993.

Career
Robinson started work for NASA in 1975 as a student intern at NASA'sAmes Research CenterinMountain View, California. After graduation from the University of California at Davis, he joined NASA Ames in 1979 as a research scientist in the fields offluid dynamics,aerodynamics, experimental instrumentation, and computational scientific visualization. While at Ames, Robinson earned masters and doctorate degrees in mechanical engineering at Stanford University, with research emphasis inturbulencephysics, and additional research inhuman eyedynamics. In 1990, Robinson was selected as Chief of the Experimental Flow Physics Branch at NASA'sLangley Research CenterinHampton, Virginia, where he led a group of 35 engineers and scientists engaged in aerodynamics and fluid physics research.
In 1993, Robinson was awarded the NASA/Space Club Low Memorial Engineering Fellowship, and was assigned for 15 months to theMassachusetts Institute of Technology(MIT) as Visiting Engineer in the Man Vehicle Laboratory (MVL). As an MVL team-member, he conducted neurovestibular research on astronauts on the Spacelab Life Sciences 2 Shuttle mission (STS-58). Other MIT research included EVA dynamics for satellite capture and space construction. While inCambridge, Massachusetts, Robinson was also a visiting scientist at theU.S. Department of Transportation'sVolpe National Transportation Systems Center, doing research on environmental modeling forflight simulation, cockpit human factors forGPS-guided instrument approach procedures, and moving-map displays.
Robinson returned to NASA Langley in September 1994, where he accepted a dual assignment as research scientist in theMultidisciplinary design optimizationBranch, and as leader of theAerodynamicsandAcousticselement of NASA's General Aviation Technology program.
Robinson has logged over 1,400 hours in aircraft ranging from antiquetaildraggersto NASA jets.
Robinson began applying to become an astronaut in 1983, and was selected to joinNASA Astronaut Corpsin 1995.  He has flown on fourSpace Shuttlemissions:STS-85,STS-95,STS-114andSTS-130.  Robinson served as backup flight engineer for theInternational Space StationExpedition 4.[1]
On August 3, 2005, as a Mission Specialist (and Flight Engineer) on STS-114, the first Return to Flight mission following theSpace Shuttle Columbia disaster, Robinson became the first human to perform anin-flight repairto the Shuttle's exterior. Robinson was sent to remove two protruding gap fillers onDiscovery'sheat shield, after engineers determined they might pose a danger upon re-entry. Robinson successfully removed the loose material while theDiscoverywas docked to theInternational Space Station. Robinson performed another "first" on STS-114 when he made the firstpodcastfrom space (transcript & audio) on August 7, 2005. His self-portrait took during the repair was considered one of the earlyspace selfies.[2]
Robinson served as amission specialistand flight engineer onSTS-130, which launched on February 8, 2010, and rendezvoused with the International Space Station on February 10. As Intravehicular Officer, he choreographed the three EVAs involved with the installation and activation of theNode 3 moduleandCupola.
Robinson also served asCAPCOMfor various Space Shuttle missions.
He retired from the Astronaut Corps in July 2012 to take a teaching position as a full-time professor in the Mechanical and Aerospace Engineering department atUniversity of California at Davis. "Steve will be sorely missed by the Astronaut Office," saidJanet Kavandi, Director of Flight Crew Operations. "He was a fellow classmate, and I will personally miss his ever-positive attitude and smiling face. We wish him the best in his future endeavors, and we are confident that he will be a positive influence and wonderful mentor to inquisitive minds at the University of California at Davis."[3]
Robinson currently directs the UC Davis Center for Human/Robotics/Vehicle Integration and Performance (HRVIP).[4]

Personal life
He enjoysflying,antiqueaircraft,swimming,canoeing,hiking,music,art, andstereo photography. He plays leadguitarinMax Q, arock and rollband. HisCanadianparents, William, alandsurveyor, and Joyce Robinson, resided inMoraga, California.
