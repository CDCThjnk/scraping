Millie Elizabeth Hughes-Fulford(néeHughes; December 21, 1945 – February 2, 2021) was an American medical investigator, molecular biologist, andpayload specialistwho flew aboard theNASASpace ShuttleColumbiain June 1991.[2]

Early life
Millie Elizabeth Hughes was born inMineral Wells, Texason December 21, 1945.[3][1][2]She graduated fromMineral Wells High Schoolin 1962,[4]then enteredcollegeat the age of 16 and earned herBachelor of Sciencedegree inchemistryandbiologyfromTarleton State Universityin 1968.[5]She then began her graduate work studyingplasma chemistryatTexas Woman's Universityas aNational Science FoundationGraduate Fellow from 1968 to 1971 and earned herPh.D.in 1972.[6][7]From 1971 to 1972, she was also both anAmerican Association of University WomenFellow and aMacArthur FoundationFellow.[8]

Career
After earning herdoctoratedegree in 1972, Dr. Hughes-Fulford applied to roughly 100 jobs in academia, from which she received four replies.[4]This resulted in her joining the faculty ofUniversity of Texas Southwestern Medical Centerin Dallas as apostdoctoral fellowwithMarvin D. Siperstein, where her research focused on the regulation ofcholesterolmetabolism.[9]Within a couple of years, she relocated with her laboratory toSan Francisco.[4]
In 1978, she noticed a printed recruiting advertisement calling for femaleastronauts, which led her to apply for the space program. Out of the 8000 applicants, Hughes-Fulford was in the top 20 but did not make it intoNASA Astronaut Group 8.[4]She was not deterred and continued pursuing a career in space; she was also a member of theU.S. Army Reserve Medical Corps, achieving the rank ofmajorand serving from 1981 until 1995.[2]

NASA
Selected into apayload specialistbyNASAin January 1983, Hughes-Fulford flew in June 1991 aboardSTS-40Spacelab Life Sciences (SLS 1), the first Spacelab mission dedicated to biomedical studies. SLS-1 was also the first mission to have a crew with three female members, and Hughes-Fulford was both NASA's first female payload specialist in orbit and the first representative of theUnited States Department of Veterans Affairsin space.[6]The mission flew over 3.2 million miles in 146 orbits and its crew completed over 18 experiments during a nine-day period, bringing back more medical data than any previous NASA flight. Mission duration was 218 hours, 14 minutes and 21 seconds, or 9 days, 2 hours, 14 minutes, and 20 seconds.[9][10][11]

Later career
After her space mission for NASA, Hughes-Fulford was aprofessorat theUniversity of California, San Francisco Medical Centerwhere she continued her research until her death in 2021. She created and directed the Hughes-Fulford Laboratory[12]at theSan Francisco VA Medical Center, where her research focus includedimmunology,bioastronautics, andoncology.[4]
She was the Principal Investigator (PI) on a series of SpaceHab/Biorack experiments, which examined the regulation ofosteoblast(bonecell) growth.[9]These experiments flew onSTS-76, in March 1996,STS-81in January 1997, andSTS-84in May 1997, and studied the root causes ofosteoporosisthat occurs in astronauts during spaceflight.[2]One experiment resulted in observations of changes inanabolicsignal transductioninmicrogravity.[9]A later collaborator was Dr. Augusto Cogoli ofZürich, Switzerland; one experiment with Dr. Cogoli was lost in theSpace ShuttleColumbiadisaster,[9]and another experiment using technology fromAffymetrixandreverse transcription polymerase chain reaction(RT-PCR) examined changes in T-cell gene induction in spaceflight on a joint NASA/ESAInternational Space Stationmission that launched on theSoyuz TMA-9in 2006.[9]
Further studies of gene regulation and signal transduction in spaceflight were approved in January 2002 forShuttle/ISSexperiments examiningprotein kinase C(PKC) signal activation. She flew her most recent experiments to ISS on aSpaceXrocket in collaboration with the ISS International Laboratory, theEuropean Space Agency, and theNational Institutes of Health. In those studies, she found one basis for changes in the immune system in spaceflight.[6]Many of her publications are available at her laboratory web site.[12]
Hughes-Fulford contributed over 120 papers and abstracts, including on bone andcancergrowth regulation, and on the effect of spaceflight on the immune system at the cell molecular and systems biology level.[9]She was a member of theAmerican Association for the Advancement of Science,American Society for Gravitational Science and Biology,American Society for Bone and Mineral Research,American Society for Cell Biology,American Society of Hematologyand theAssociation of Space Explorers.[9]

Personal life
Hughes-Fulford was married twice. Her first marriage was to policeman Rick Wiley, with whom she had a daughter, and ended in divorce in the late 1970s. Her second marriage was in 1983 to George Fulford, aUnited Airlinespilot whom she met in 1981. She died inMill Valley, California, on February 2, 2021, oflymphoma,[4]which was the subject of her last research paper.[5][1]
