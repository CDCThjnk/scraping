Career

NASA experience
Harbaugh came to NASA'sJohnson Space Centerafter graduation from Purdue University in 1978. He held engineering and technical management positions in Space Shuttle flight operations, and supported Shuttle flight operations from Mission Control for most of the flights fromSTS-1throughSTS-51-L. He served as LeadData ProcessingSystems (DPS) Officer forSTS-9(Spacelab-1) andSTS-41-D, Orbit DPS forSTS-41-BandSTS-41-C, and Ascent/Entry DPS forSTS-41-G. He also served as a seniorflight controlleraddressing issues requiring real-time resolution, for several flights fromSTS-51-Athrough STS-51-L.[3]
Harbaugh has a commercial pilot's license with instrument rating, and over 1600 hours total flying time.
Selected by NASA in June 1987, Harbaugh became an astronaut in August 1988. His technical assignments included work in theShuttle Avionics Integration Laboratory(SAIL), the ShuttleRemote Manipulator System(RMS), telerobotics systems development forSpace Station, theHubble Space Telescopeservicing mission development, spacecraft communicator (CAPCOM) in Mission Control, andextravehicular activity(EVA) for theInternational Space Station(ISS). He was assigned as the backup EVA crew member and capsule communicator (Capcom) forSTS-61, the first Hubble Space Telescope servicing mission.[3]
A veteran of four space flights, Harbaugh has logged a total of 818 hours in space, including 18 hours, 29 minutes EVA. From 1997 to 2001 Harbaugh served as Manager of the Extravehicular Activity Project Office, with program management responsibility for all aspects of NASA's spacewalk industry, including spacesuits, tools, training, tasks and operations for the Space Shuttle, the International Space Station, and future planetary missions. Harbaugh left NASA in March 2001.[4]

Space flight experience
STS-39Discovery(April 28 through May 6, 1991) was an eight-day unclassifiedDepartment of Defensemission involving research for theStrategic Defense Initiative. Harbaugh flew as a mission specialist and was responsible for operation of the RMS and the Infrared Background Signature Survey (IBSS) spacecraft, and he was one of two crewmen trained for EVA in the event of a contingency requiring a spacewalk. Mission duration was 199 hours, 22 minutes.[5]
STS-54Endeavour(January 13–19, 1993) was a six-day mission which featured the deployment of TDRS-F, and a 4-hour 28-minute space walk by Harbaugh. Mission duration was 143 hours 38 minutes.[6]
STS-71Atlantis(June 27 to July 7, 1995) was the first docking mission with the RussianSpace Station Mir, and involved an exchange of crews. On this mission, Harbaugh served as the Flight Engineer (Mission Specialist) on a seven-member (up) eight-member (down) crew. Space ShuttleAtlantiswas modified to carry a docking system compatible with the Russian Mir Space Station, and Harbaugh was responsible for the inflight operation of the docking system. He was also assigned to perform any contingency EVA. Mission duration was 235 hours, 23 minutes.[7]
STS-82Discovery(February 11–21, 1997) the second Hubble Space Telescope (HST) servicing mission. It was a night launch and landing flight. During the 10-day mission, the crew retrieved and secured the HST inDiscovery's payload bay. In five spacewalks, two teams installed two new spectrometers and eight replacement instruments, and placed insulation patches over several compartments containing key data processing, electronics and scientific instrument telemetry packages. Harbaugh participated in two spacewalks, totaling 14 hours and 01 minute. Following completion of upgrades and repairs, HST was redeployed and boosted to its highest orbit ever. Mission duration was 239 hours, 37 minutes.[8]
