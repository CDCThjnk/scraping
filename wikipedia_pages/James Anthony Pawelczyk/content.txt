His hobbies include cycling, swimming, woodworking, philately, and outdoor activities. Pawelczyk is the first American astronaut of full-blooded Polish descent to go into space. (Polish CosmonautMirosław Hermaszewskiwas the first Pole in space in 1978 when he flew aboard aSoyuz 30spacecraft as part of a Soviet bloc program 'Interkosmos'.) In 1999, Pawelczyk and three other astronauts from the STS-90 crew were guests of State of the Republic of Poland. He presented the president with the Polish flag that flew with him aboard space shuttle,Columbia. His parents, Joe and Rita, along with representatives of thePolish American Congressfrom Buffalo and Chicago accompanied the crew on their visit. He has two children.

Pawelczyk graduated from Iroquois Central High School,Elma,New York, in 1978. He went on to earn aBAdegree in biology and aBAdegree in psychology from theUniversity of Rochester, New York, in 1982. Subsequently, he obtained aMSdegree inphysiologyin 1985, and aPhDdegree inbiology(physiology) from theUniversity of North Texasin 1989.

Academic career
He conducted apost-doctoral fellowshipin cardiovascular neurophysiology at theUniversity of Texas Southwestern Medical Centerbetween 1989 and 1992. Pawelczyk was also avisiting scientistat the Department of Anaesthesia of theRigshospitaletinCopenhagen, Denmark, in 1990. Next, he became anassistant professorof medicine (cardiology) at theUniversity of Texas Southwestern Medical Centerfrom 1992 to 1995.

Pawelczyk took leave from Penn State University to fly as a payload specialist on STS-90 (Neurolab).
Pawelczyk is co-editor ofBlood Loss and Shock, published in 1994. He has been a principal investigator or co-investigator on 11 federal and state grants and contracts, and has over 20 refereed journal articles and 3 invited book chapters in the areas of cardiovascular regulation and cardiovascular physiology.

NASA career
User design group, GASMAP (Gas Analysis System for Metabolic Analysis Physiology); Unit principal investigator for the NASA Specialized Center for Outreach, Research and Training (NSCORT) grant in integrative physiology. He received a NASA Young Investigator Award in 1994 for his work in the area of autonomic neurophysiology. Pawelczyk was a co-investigator for experiments flown on the Neurolab mission, and two Shuttle-Mir (Phase 1B) flights. Pawelczyk served as a payload specialist onSTS-90Neurolab (April 17 to May 3, 1998). During the 16-day Spacelab flight the seven person crew aboardSpace Shuttle Columbiaserved as both experiment subjects and operators for 26 individual life science experiments focusing on the effects of microgravity on the brain and nervous system. TheSTS-90flight orbited the Earth 256 times, covered 6.3 million miles, and logged over 381 hours in space.[1]Pawelczyk testified before the U.S. Senate Committee on Commerce, Science & Transportation in 2003. His testimony advocated strengthening research on board the International Space Station. He is a standing member of NASA's Life Sciences Advisory Subcommittee, and served as a member of the Research Maximization and Prioritization (ReMAP) Taskforce in 2002.
