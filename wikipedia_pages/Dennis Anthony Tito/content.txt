Dennis Anthony Tito(born August 8, 1940) is an Americanengineerandentrepreneur. During mid-2001, he became the firstspace touristto fund his own visit to space, when he spent nearly eight days in orbit as a crew member ofISS EP-1, a visiting mission to theInternational Space Station. This mission was launched by the spacecraftSoyuz TM-32, and was landed bySoyuz TM-31.

Life and career
Tito was born in Queens,New York. He graduated fromForest Hills High Schoolin New York City. He holds aBachelor of Sciencedegree inastronauticsandaeronauticsfromNew York University, 1962 and aMaster of Sciencedegree inengineering sciencefromRensselaer Polytechnic Institutesatellite campus in Hartford, Connecticut.[2]He is a member ofPsi Upsilonand received an honorary doctorate of engineering from Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute on May 18, 2002 and is a former scientist of theNASAJet Propulsion Laboratory.[3]
Tito was appointed to theLos Angeles Department of Water and PowerBoard of Commissioners during the 1990s and as such he facilitated the 1994 state ruling protectingMono Lakefrom excessive water diversions by the city.[4]

Investment career
In 1972, he foundedWilshire Associates, a major provider of investment management, consulting and technology services inSanta Monica, California.  Tito serves an international clientele representing assets of $71 billion.[5]Wilshire usesquantitative analyticsto analyze market risks – a method Tito is credited with helping to develop by applying the same techniques he used to determine a spacecraft's path at JPL.[3]Despite a career change fromaerospace engineeringtoinvestment management, Tito remained interested inspace.[6]
In 2020, Tito sold his interest inWilshire Associates.[7]

Personal life
Dennis divorced from his wife Suzanne Tito during the early 1990s, to whom he had been married since the 1970s.[8][7]They had 2 children together.[9]She had been CFO of Wilshire Associates at the time they relocated into their mansion in Pacific Palisades in 1990 with their children, that they had been building since 1987.[10]
As of 2011 Dennis was married to Elizabeth Pavlova Tito, a Russian investor and Stanford alumna. They lived at Pacific Palisades in Los Angeles.[8]
From 2016 to 2019, Dennis was married toElizabeth TenHouten,[11][9]a businesswoman, poet, author and model.[12][13]
Since 2020, Dennis has been married to Akiko Tito, an engineer, pilot, and investor, who has been interested in spaceflight since childhood.[14][15]She was born in Tokyo, has an economics degree and relocated to New York in 1995, raising a child prior to her marriage to Dennis.[9]

21st century space interests
In a project first arranged byMirCorp,[when?]Tito was accepted by theRussian Federal Space Agencyas a candidate for acommercial spaceflight. Tito was criticised by NASA before the launch, primarily byDaniel Goldin, at that time theAdministrator of NASA, who considered it inappropriate for a tourist to ride into space.[6][16]MirCorp, Goldin and Tito are profiled in the documentary movieOrphans of Apollo.[needs update]When Tito arrived at theJohnson Space Centerfor additional training for theAmerican portionof the ISS,Robert D. Cabana, NASA manager, sent Tito and his two fellow cosmonauts home, stating, "...We will not be able to begin training, because we are not willing to train with Dennis Tito".[17]
Later,[when?]by an arrangement with space tourism companySpace Adventures, Ltd.,[18]Tito joined theSoyuz TM-32mission which launched on April 28, 2001.[19]The spacecraft docked with the International Space Station.  Tito and his fellow cosmonauts spent 7 days, 22 hours, 4 minutes in space and orbited the Earth 128 times.[18]Tito performed several scientific experiments in orbit that he said would be useful for his company and business.[citation needed]
Since returning from space, he has testified at the Senate Committee on Commerce, Science & Transportation, Subcommittee on Science, Technology, and Space and the House Committee on Science, Subcommittee on Space & Aeronautics Joint Hearing on "Commercial Human Spaceflight" on July 24, 2003.[20]Ten years after his flight, he gave an interview to BBC News about it.[21]
In February 2013, Tito announced his intention to send a privately financed spaceflight toMarsby 2018,[22]stating that the technology exists already and that the problems that need to be solved are only the rigor of a 501-day voyage psychologically and physically for the human crew.[23][24]However, in November 2013, Tito and other Mars Inspiration team members admitted that their plan was impossible without significant assistance and funding from NASA.[25]
On 12 October 2022, SpaceX announced that Dennis and Akiko Tito will be on the crew of the second commercial spaceflight ofStarshiparound the Moon.[26][needs update]
