Anatoly Yakovlevich Solovyev(Russian:Анатолий Яковлевич Соловьёв;Latvian:Anatolijs Solovjovs; alternate spelling "Solovyov"; born 16 January 1948) is a retired Latvian andSovietcosmonautand pilot.[1]Solovyev holds theworld recordon the number ofspacewalksperformed (16) and accumulated time spent spacewalking (over 82 hours).[2]

Education
Solovyev studied at Riga Secondary School No. 33. After completing secondary school in Riga at age 16, he was a general labourer at a building materials factory, and then a metalworker. He completed two years of evening school and in 1967, enrolled at the Faculty of Physics and Mathematics of theState University of Latvia. After completing the first year, Anatoly left training to prepare for aviation school while working as a locksmith at the Latvian Joint Aviation Unit. In 1968 Solovyov began his training at the Chernigov Higher Military Aviation School.[3]

Military service
He enrolled as a cadet in the Chernigov Higher Military School of Pilots in 1968. He joined theCPSUin 1971. He graduated from the Lenin Komsomol Chernigov Higher Military Aviation School in 1972,[4]having flown theL-29,MiG-15UTI andMiG-21. Subsequently, he was assigned to a reconnaissance air regiment in the Far East Aviation District,[5]flying theMiG-21R. In 1975 he was awarded the qualification "Military Pilot 1st Class".

Cosmonaut
He was selected for Cosmonaut training 23 August 1976 as a member of TsPK-6. Uniquely, this group was to train as pilots for theBuran programme(Soviet "space shuttle"), and as such had to also qualify as test pilots.[6][7][8][9][circular reference]To do so the group first attended the 267th Centre for Testing Aviation Equipment and Training Test Pilots atAkhtubinskwhere they passed as test pilots (third class). This was followed up by a year's training to qualify as Cosmonauts. They then returned to Akhtubinsk for further training as test pilots (second class). In addition he qualified as a parachutist and diver. In January 1979 he was appointed as a Test Cosmonaut in OK CPC (aerospace vehicles) working on Buran.
Delays with Buran and increased need for space station crews resulted in his transferring to training for theInterkosmosprogramme in January 1982. The following year he was designated as a reserve crew commander for missions to Salyut 7, withAleksandr Serebrovand Nikolai Moskalenko. In 1985 he was assigned as reserve crew commander of Soyuz T-15 withViktor Savinykh. The following year he was assigned as back up commander of the Soyuz TM-3 mission to Mir with Savinykh and Munir Habib (Syria).[10]
He was commander for the 9-dayMir EP-2visiting ("lifeboat" swap) crew June 1988 launched aboardSoyuz TM-5and returned aboardSoyuz TM-4. His crew wereViktor SavinykhandAleksandr Aleksandrov(of Bulgaria). He thus became the 65th Soviet Cosmonaut with the personal callsign "Spring".[11]
He then served as the back up commander forSoyuz TM-8. Commander 179 daySoyuz TM-9/Mir EO-6long-duration mission February to August 1990, withAleksandr Balandin. This included an EVA to repair thermal blankets on Soyuz TM-9, and a second EVA when repairs to theKvant-2module hatch were unsuccessfully attempted.
He served as reserve crew commander with Andrei Zaytsev for Mir EO-10 but the crew was disbanded after flight programme changes. He was back up commanderMir EO-11/Soyuz TM-14.
He was commander for the 188-dayMir EO-12/Soyuz TM-15withSergei Avdeyev, from July 1992 until February 1993. He conducted four more EVAs during the mission. Launching only with them wasMichel Togniniof France.
He served as back up commander ofMir EO-18, and then as commander ofMir EO-19withNikolai Budarin. They launched as passengers aboardSpace ShuttleAtlantison theSTS-71mission in June 1995. This was at the first Orbiter docking with Mir, and the EO-19 crew undockedSoyuz TM-21briefly to observe and photograph the departure ofAtlantis.[12]Solovyev also performed three EVAs. They returned to Earth aboardSoyuz TM-21in September after 75 days.
His final space mission was as commander ofMir EO-24/Soyuz TM-26for 197 days from August 1997 until February 1998 withPavel Vinogradov. After an automaticKursapproach, Solovyev performed the final docking manually when he was unable to verify the accuracy of the automatic targeting. They joined NASA astronautMichael Foalewho transferred fromEO-23until his departure aboardAtlantis. He was replaced byDavid Wolfand thenAndrew Thomaswho remained to joinEO-25. His first EVA on 22 August 1997 was an unusual "internal spacewalk"[13]to connect power and survey damage to the depressurised Spektr module. This had been holed in the collision withProgress M-34on 25 June.[14]Solovyev performed six more EVAs to set a world record total of 16, with a world record combined duration of 82 hours 21 minutes. He commented:
"It just came about. I never referred to my numbers as a record, nor did I ever think about beating someone else's accomplishments before going out on a walk."[15]
He was tapped to be on the crew of the first expedition to occupy the International Space Station. However he declined to serve under an American commander for the long-duration mission, since his experience of long-duration spaceflight far exceeded that of any American astronaut.[16]
Solovyev left the Cosmonaut Detachment in 1999 having reached compulsory retirement age and became the president of "For the Good of the Fatherland", a national organisation recognising the work of Russians devoted to cultural and social development.[17]
