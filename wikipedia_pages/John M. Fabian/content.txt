John McCreary Fabian(born January 28, 1939) is a formerNASAastronautand Air Force officer who flew twoSpace Shuttlemissions and worked on the development of the Shuttle's robotic arm.  He later led the Air Force's space operations.

Personal data
Born January 28, 1939, inGoose Creek, Texas, but considersPullman, Washington, to be his hometown. He was active in theBoy Scouts of Americawhere he achieved its second-highest rank,Life Scout. Recreational interests includepoliticsand environmental advocacy.[1]
In 1998 he retired toPort Ludlow, Washington, bordered byHood Canaland theOlympic Mountainson northwest Washington'sOlympic Peninsula. In 2002 he helped form the Hood Canal Coalition, an environmental watchdog group opposing a new industrial harbor complex and a gravel mine's shipping operation slated to transverse theHood Canal Bridge.[1]
From 2000 to 2011, he participated in the "Lunch with an Astronaut" and "Astronaut Encounter" events at theKennedy Space Center Visitor Complex. He resumed his involvement in 2022, and has since been a regular feature in the restructured "Chat with an Astronaut" program, as well as "Astronaut Encounter".[2]

Education
Graduated fromPullman High School, Pullman, Washington, in 1957; received aBachelor of Sciencedegree inmechanical engineeringfromWashington State Universityin 1962;[3]aMaster of Sciencedegree inaerospace engineeringfrom the U.S.Air Force Institute of Technologyin 1964; and adoctorateinaeronauticsandastronauticsfrom theUniversity of Washingtonin 1974. While at Washington State University, he was a member of thePhi Sigma Kappafraternity. Member ofTau Beta PiandSigma Tauengineering honor societies.[1]WSU Commander ofArnold Air Society1960–61.

Military experience
Fabian, an Air ForceROTCstudent atWashington State University, was commissioned upon graduation in 1962. After an assignment at the U.S.Air Force Institute of TechnologyatWright-Patterson Air Force Base,Ohio, he was assigned as an aeronautics engineer in the service engineering division, San Antonio Air Material Area,Kelly Air Force Base,Texas. He then attended flight training atWilliams Air Force Base,Arizona, and subsequently spent 5 years as aKC-135co-pilot, aircraft commander, andinstructor pilotatWurtsmith Air Force Base,Michigan. He saw action inSoutheast Asia, flying 90combat missionsduring theVietnam War.[1]Following additional graduate work at theUniversity of Washington, he served 4 years on the faculty of the Aeronautics Department at theU.S. Air Force AcademyinColoradowhere he was a tenuredassociate professor.[4]
He has logged 4,000 hours flying time, including 3,400 hours injet aircraft.[1]

NASA experience
Selected as an astronaut candidate by NASA in January 1978, and became an astronaut in August 1979. During the following years, he worked extensively on satellite deployment and retrieval activities, including development of the CanadianRemote Manipulator System. A veteran of two space flights, he has logged over 316 hours in space. He served as a mission specialist on STS-7 (June 18 – 24, 1983) and STS-51G (June 17–24, 1985). He was scheduled to fly next in May 1986 on STS-61G, and was also in training for space shuttle life science mission SLS-1. Fabian instead left NASA on January 1, 1986, to become Director of Space, Deputy Chief of Staff, Plans and Operations, Headquarters USAF.[1]
Colonel Fabian retired from the USAF in June 1987 and joined Analytic Services, a non-profit aerospace public service research institute inArlington, Virginia, where he retired as president and chief executive officer in 1998.[5][4]He currently lives in Port Ludlow, Washington.  Fabian continues to serve as an independent consultant and public speaker on the NASA space program and environmental stewardship.

Space flight experience
Fabian first flew as a mission specialist onSTS-7, which launched fromKennedy Space Center, Florida, on June 18, 1983. This was the second flight for the OrbiterChallengerand for the first mission with a 5-person crew. During the mission, the crew deployed satellites for Canada (ANIK C-2) and Indonesia (PALAPA B-1); operated the Canadian-built Remote Manipulator System (RMS) to perform the first deployment and retrieval exercise with theShuttle Pallet Satellite(SPAS-01); conducted the first formation flying of the Orbiter with a free-flying satellite (SPAS-01); carried and operated the first U.S./German cooperative materials science payload (OSTA-2): and operated the Continuous Flow Electrophoresis System (CFES) and the Monodisperse Latex Reactor (MLR) experiments, in addition to activating seven Getaway Specials, Mission duration was 147 hours before landing atEdwards Air Force Base, California, on June 24, 1983.[6][7]
Fabian was the first person to deploy and subsequently retrieve a free-flying satellite.  In doing so, he used the Canadian-built robotic arm to release and later recapture the SPAS-01 satellite.[1]
On his second mission, Fabian flew onSTS-51-Gwhich launched from the Kennedy Space Center, Florida, on June 17, 1985, and landed at Edwards Air Force Base, California, on June 24, 1985, after completing approximately 170 hours of space flight. This international crew deployed communications satellites for Mexico (Morelos), theArab League(Arabsat), and the United States (AT&TTelstar). They used the Remote Manipulator System (RMS) to deploy and later retrieve the SPARTAN satellite which performed 17 hours of x-ray astronomy experiments while separated from the Space Shuttle. In addition, the crew activated the Automated Directional Solidification Furnace (ADSF), six Getaway Specials, participated in biomedical experiments, and conducted a laser tracking experiment as part of theStrategic Defense Initiative.[1][8]
