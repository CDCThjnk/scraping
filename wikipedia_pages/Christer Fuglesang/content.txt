Arne Christer Fuglesang(born 18 March 1957) is a Swedish physicist and anESAastronaut. He was first launched aboard theSTS-116Space Shuttle mission on 10 December 2006, making him the first Swedish citizen in space.[2]
Married with three children, he was aFellowatCERNand taught mathematics at theRoyal Institute of Technologybefore being selected to join theEuropean Astronaut Corpsin 1992. He has participated in twoSpace Shuttlemissions and fivespacewalks, and is the first person outside of the United States or Russian space programs to participate in more than three spacewalks.

Early life and education
Fuglesang was born inStockholmto a Swedish mother and a Norwegian father, who became a Swedish citizen shortly before Fuglesang's birth. Fuglesang graduated from theBromma Gymnasium, Stockholm in 1975, earned a master's degree inengineering physicsfrom theRoyal Institute of Technology(KTH), in Stockholm in 1981, and received a doctorate in experimentalparticle physicsfromStockholm Universityin 1987. He became an associate professor (docent) of particle physics at Stockholm University in 1991.
He married Elisabeth (Lisa) Fuglesang (néeWalldie) in 1983, whom he met at the Royal Institute of Technology (KTH). They have three children.
Fuglesang is a prominent member of the Swedish skeptics associationVetenskap och Folkbildning[3]and identifies strongly withskepticsand atheists.[4]
In 2012, Fuglesang received the Royal Institute of Technology 2012 Alumni of the Year award.

Career
As a graduate student, Fuglesang worked atCERNin Geneva on theUA5 experiment, which studiedproton–antiprotoncollisions. In 1988 he became a Fellow of CERN, where he worked on theCPLEAR experimentstudying the subtleCP-violationofkaonparticles. After a year he became aSenior Fellowand head of the particle identification subdetector.[5]In November 1990, Fuglesang obtained a position at theManne Siegbahn Institute of Physics, Stockholm, but remained stationed at CERN for another year working towards the newLarge Hadron Colliderproject. Since 1990, when stationed in Sweden, Fuglesang taught mathematics at the Royal Institute of Technology.[6]
In May 1992, Fuglesang was selected to join theEuropean Astronaut Corpsof theEuropean Space Agency(ESA) based at theEuropean Astronaut Centre(EAC) inCologne, Germany. In 1992 he attended an introductory training programme at EAC and a four-week training program at theYuri Gagarin Cosmonaut Training Center(TsPK) inStar City, Russia, with a view to future ESA–Russian collaboration on theMirSpace Station. In July 1993, he completed the basic astronaut training course at EAC.[6]
In May 1993, Fuglesang and fellow ESA astronautThomas Reiterwere selected for theEuromir95 mission and commenced training at TsPK (Moscow) in preparation for their onboard engineer tasks, extra-vehicular activities (spacewalks) and operation of theSoyuz spacecraft. The Euromir 95 experiment training was organized and mainly carried out at EAC.[6]
On 17 March 1995 he was selected as a member of Crew 2, the backup crew for the Euromir 95 mission, joiningGennadi ManakovandPavel Vinogradov. During the mission, which lasted 179 days, Fuglesang was the prime crew interface coordinator. From theRussian Mission Control Center(TsUP) inKorolyov, he was the main contact with ESA Astronaut, Thomas Reiter, on Mir, and acted as coordinator between Mir and the Euromir 95 Payloads Operations Control Center, located inOberpfaffenhofen, Germany, and project management. Between March and June 1996, he underwent specialized training in TsPK on Soyuz operations for de-docking, atmospheric re-entry and landing.[6]
In 1996, ESA selected Fuglesang to train as a mission specialist for NASA Space Shuttle missions. He joined the Mission Specialist Class atNASA Johnson Space Center,Houston, in August 1996, and qualified for flight assignment as amission specialistin April 1998.[6]
From May to October 1998, he resumed training at TsPK on Soyuz-TM spacecraft operations for de-docking, atmospheric re-entry and landing. He was awarded the RussianSoyuz Return Commandercertificate, which qualifies him to command a three-person Soyuz capsule on its return from space.[6]
In October 1998, he returned to NASA and was assigned technical duties in the Station Operations System Branch of the NASA Astronaut Office, working on Russian Soyuz and Progress transfer vehicles. Later he worked as prime Increment Crew Support Astronaut for the second International Space Station expedition crew. Fuglesang also continued with some scientific work and was involved with the SilEye experiment which investigated light flashes in astronauts' eyes on Mir between 1995 and 1999.[7]This work is continuing on theInternational Space Station(ISS) with the Alteino and ALTEA apparatuses. He has also initiated the DESIRE project to simulate and estimate the radiation environment inside ISS.[6]

Missions

STS-116
Fuglesang's first spaceflight mission was as a mission specialist onSTS-116in 2006, an assembly and crew-rotation mission to the International Space Station. This flight was called theCelsius Missionby ESA in recognition ofAnders Celsius, the Swedish 18th-centuryastronomerwho invented the Celsius temperature scale.
 - First spacewalk with the primary task of Installation of theP5 truss segmentperformed together with AstronautRobert Curbeamas EV1, 12 December.[8]
 - EV2 during second spacewalk which included first part of rewiring the power system of the ISS specifically channel 2 and 3. Also performed together with Astronaut Robert Curbeam as EV1, 14 December.[9]
 - An extra spacewalk (EVA4) attempting, successfully, to fix a problem when retracting a solar panel. Also performed together with Astronaut Robert Curbeam as EV1, 18 December. EVA duration: 6h 38min.[10]
Total EVA time during STS-116: 18 hours and 15 minutes.
Fuglesang,  once a Swedish nationalFrisbeechampion, held the national title in "maximum time aloft" in 1978, and subsequently competed in the 1981 World Frisbee Championship. Fuglesang took one of his personal frisbees to the International Space Station. On Dec 15 in 2006, he set a new "world record" for Time Aloft by free-floating a spinning frisbee for 20 seconds in themicrogravity environmentof the ISS. It was done during a live broadcast interview with a space exhibition in Stockholm Sweden.  The record attempt was recognised by the sports governing body, theWorld Flying Disc Federation, and the record was accepted. But since it was set "outside the earth's atmosphere" it was recorded as 'Galactic Record'.[11][12]

STS-128
On 15 July 2008 Fuglesang was selected as a mission specialist of theSTS-128, launched on 28–29 August 2009.[13][14]STS-128 (ISS assembly mission "17A") delivered equipment allowing the ISS crew to be expanded from three to six astronauts.
During STS-128 Fuglesang also became the first spacewalker outside Russia and United States to do more than three spacewalks. With the completion of two more EVAs, he has performed five spacewalks.

EVA
Total EVA time from five spacewalks adds up to 31 hours 54 minutes giving Fuglesang a 29th place in history as of 14 September 2009.

Autobiography
In 2007, Fuglesang published his autobiography, a photo book co-written by Swedish journalistJohan Tell. Being born the same year at the launch of Sputnik (1957) made him a child of the space age, he writes. His admiration for cosmonautes and astronautes was thus awakened at an early age. He attended Gagarin's memorial in 1993, March 27th. Fuglesang does not, however, believe that Gagarin claimed not to have seen God in space and thus concluded he didn't exist.
