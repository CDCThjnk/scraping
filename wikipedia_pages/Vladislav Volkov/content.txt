Vladislav Nikolayevich Volkov(Russian:Владислав Николаевич Волков; 23 November 1935 – 30 June 1971) was a Sovietcosmonautwho flew on theSoyuz 7andSoyuz 11missions. The second missionterminated fatally.[1][2]Volkov and the two other crew members wereasphyxiatedon reentry, the only three people to have died in outer space.

Biography
Volkov graduated from theMoscow Aviation Institutein 1959.[3]As an aviation engineer at Korolyov Design Bureau, he was involved in the development of the Vostok and Voskhod spacecraft prior to his selection as a cosmonaut. He flew aboard Soyuz 7 in 1969.
Volkov, on his second space mission in 1971, was assigned to Soyuz 11 along withGeorgy DobrovolskyandViktor Patsayev. The three cosmonauts on this flight spent 23 days onSalyut 1, the world's first space station. After three relatively placid weeks in orbit, however, Soyuz 11 became the second Sovietspace flightto terminate fatally, afterSoyuz 1.
After a normalre-entry, the Soyuz 11 capsule was opened and the corpses of the three crew members were found inside.[4]It was discovered that a valve had opened just before leaving orbit that had allowed the capsule's atmosphere tovent away into space, causing Volkov and his two flight companions to suffer fatalhypoxiaas their cabin descended toward the Earth's atmosphere.[5]
