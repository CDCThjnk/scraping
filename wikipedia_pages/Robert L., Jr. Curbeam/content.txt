Spaceflight experience
STS-85(August 7–19, 1997) was a 12-day mission during which the crew deployed and retrieved the CRISTA-SPAS payload, operated the Japanese Manipulator Flight Demonstration (MFD) robotic arm, studied changes in theEarth's atmosphere, and tested technology destined for use on the futureInternational Space Station.[1]
STS-98(February 7–20, 2001) continued the task of building and enhancing theInternational Space Stationby delivering the U.S. laboratory moduleDestiny. TheShuttlespent seven days docked to the station while Destiny was attached. In helping to complete its assembly, Curbeam logged over 19EVAhours in 3 space walks.[1]
STS-116(December 9–22, 2006) was a mission to the International Space Station. The mission involved the installation of a new truss segment and the rewiring of the station's electrical system. During the mission, Curbeam was the EVA crewmember for the record-breaking four spacewalks, three of which were conducted along with astronautChrister Fuglesang(Sweden) and one along with astronautSunita Williams.[1]

Post-NASA career
On December 7, 2007, NASA announced that Curbeam had chosen to leave NASA after 13 years, to pursue a job in the private sector.[2]He presently works for Northrop Grumman Innovation Systems as the Senior Director of Business Development in Virginia.[3]
