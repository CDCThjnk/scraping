During the 7-day mission the crew successfully deployed theLong Duration Exposure Facility(LDEF); retrieved the ailingSolar Maximum Missionsatellite, repaired it on board the orbitingChallengerand replaced it in orbit, using the robot arm called theRemote Manipulator System(RMS). The mission also included flight testing ofManned Maneuvering Units(MMU's) in two extra-vehicular activities (EVA's); operation of the Cinema 360 andIMAXCamera Systems, as well as a Bee Hive Honeycomb Structures student experiment. The mission was accomplished in 107 Earth orbits in 167 hours, 40 minutes, 7 seconds.[2]
STS-51-I:Discovery(August 27 to September 3, 1985) launched from the Kennedy Space Center, Florida, and returned to land at Edwards Air Force Base, California. During this mission, the crew successfully deployed three communications satellites, the Navy's Syncom IV-4, AustralianAUSSAT, andAmerican Satellite Company's ASC-1. The crew also performed the successful salvage of the ailing Navy Syncom IV-3 satellite. These tasks included two extravehicular activities (EVA's) in which Dr. Van Hoften attached to the Remote Manipulator System (RMS) performed the first manual grapple and manual deployment of a satellite in orbit. The mission also included the Physical Vapor Transport of Organic Solids (PVTOS), the second material processing experiment to be flown aboard a Shuttle for 3M. The mission was accomplished in 112 orbits of theEarthin 171 hours, 17 minutes, 42 seconds.[2]

Post-NASA career
Dr. Van Hoften is a former seniorVice Presidentandpartnerof theBechtel Corporation.
