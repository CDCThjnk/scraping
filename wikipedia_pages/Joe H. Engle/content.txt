Joe Henry Engle(August 26, 1932 – July 10, 2024) was an American pilot,aeronautical engineer, andNASAastronaut. He was the commander of twoSpace Shuttlemissions includingSTS-2in 1981, the program's second orbital flight. He also flew two flights in the Shuttle program's 1977Approach and Landing Tests. Engle was one of twelve pilots who flew theNorth American X-15, an experimentalspaceplanejointly operated by the Air Force and NASA.
As an X-15 pilot, Engle made three flights above 50 miles (80 km), thus qualifying forastronaut wingsunder the American convention for theboundary of space. In 1966, he was selected for NASA's5th Astronaut Group, joining theApollo program. He was backupLunar ModulePilot (LMP) forApollo 14and was originally scheduled to walk on the Moon as LMP forApollo 17. However, cancellation of later flights prompted NASA to select geologist-astronautHarrison Schmittas the Lunar Module Pilot, displacing Engle.

Biography

Personal life and education
Engle was born on August 26, 1932, inAbilene, Kansas.[1]He was raised inChapman, Kansas, where he attended primary and secondary school.[2]Engle graduated fromDickinson County High Schoolin 1950.[3]He was active as aBoy Scoutand earned the rank ofFirst Class.[4]Engle received aBachelor of Sciencedegree inAerospace Engineeringfrom theUniversity of Kansasin 1955, where he was a member of theTheta TauProfessional Engineering Fraternity.[5][6]
Engle was married to the former Mary Catherine Lawrence (1934–2004)[7]ofMission Hills, Kansas, and had two children and one stepchild.[1]After her death, he married Jeanie Carter ofHouston, Texas.[1]Engle's recreational interests includedflying(includingWorld War IIfighter aircraft),big game hunting,backpacking, and athletics.[8]He was a member of theSociety of Experimental Test Pilotsand became a Fellow in 2009.[9]
Engle died at his home in Houston, Texas on July 10, 2024, at the age of 91.[10][11]With Engle's death, all 12 pilots to fly the X-15 are now deceased.[12]

Flight experience
Engle received his commission in the U.S. Air Force through theAir Force Reserve Officer Training Corpsat theUniversity of Kansas. While in school he was a member of the Professional Engineering FraternityTheta Tau, and decided to become atest pilot. While working atCessna Aircraftduring the summer, he learned how to fly from a fellowdraftsman, Henry Dittmer.[13][14]
Engle entered flying school in 1957, and received hispilot wingsin 1958. He flew theF-100 Super Sabrewith the474th Fighter Day Squadronand the309th Tactical Fighter SquadronatGeorge Air Force Base, California.Chuck Yeagerrecommended Engle forAir Force Experimental Flight Test Pilot School, from which he graduated in 1961, and he was later assigned to the third class of theAerospace Research Pilot School, despite his reluctance to leave "stick and rudder" flying for aspace capsule.[14]
After serving as a test pilot in the Fighter Test Group atEdwards Air Force Base, California, Engle was a test pilot in theX-15 research programat Edwards from June 1963 until his assignment to the Manned Spacecraft Center (now theLyndon B. Johnson Space Center). Engle had applied with fellow ARPS studentCharles BassettandMichael Collinsto thethird NASA astronaut group, but the Air Force withdrew Engle's NASA application and instead chose him to replaceRobert M. Whitein the X-15 program, which pleased Engle.[14]
Engle's parents witnessed his X-15 flight of June 29, 1965, which exceeded an altitude of 50 miles (80 km) and qualified him forastronaut wings; he again exceeded 50 miles twice during his career of 16 flights.[14]On his final X-15 mission, free flight 153 (1-61-101), which took place on October 14, 1965, he became the first of only two pilots to accomplish a sub-orbital space flight in an X-15 without the benefit of the assistance provided by the MH-96 adaptive flight control system.[15]Despite what he later called "the best flying job in the world", Engle decided to apply again to NASA as he expected to be rotated to another Air Force assignment within a year and hoped to go to the Moon.[14]
Engle flew over 185 different types of aircraft (25 different fighters) during his career, logging more than 15,400 hours flight time of which 9,000 were injet aircraft.[1]

NASA career
Engle was one of19 astronauts selected by NASAin April 1966.[16]He served on the support crew forApollo 10. He then served as backupLunar ModulePilot for theApollo 14mission. He was due to land on theMoonas Lunar Module Pilot forApollo 17, but was replaced by geologistHarrison Schmitt.  This was a result of pressure from the scientific community to have a professional geologist explore the Moon, and not just test pilot engineers who had been given rudimentary geology training.  In response to getting bumped from the mission, he said "When you think about it, the lunar missions were geology-oriented."[8]
According to Engle,Deke Slaytonasked him whether he would prefer to fly onSkylab,Apollo–Soyuz, or the Space Shuttle; Engle responded that he would prefer the Shuttle as it was an airplane.[14]
Engle was commander of one of the two crews that flew theSpace Shuttle Approach and Landing Test Flightsfrom June through October 1977. TheSpace ShuttleEnterprisewas carried to 25,000 feet on top of theBoeing 747carrier aircraft, and then released for its two-minute glide flight to landing. In this series of flight tests, Engle evaluated the Orbiter handling qualities and landing characteristics, and obtained the stability and control, and performance data in the subsonic flight envelope for the Space Shuttle. He was the backup commander forSTS-1, the first orbital test flight ofSpace ShuttleColumbia. Together with pilotRichard Trulyhe flew as commander on the second flight of the Space Shuttle,STS-2, becoming the last NASA rookie to command a spaceflight untilRaja Chariin 2021 onSpaceX Crew-3. He was also mission commander onSTS-51-Iand logged over 225 hours in space.[14]
Engle was one of two people to have flown into space on two different types of winged vehicles: theX-15and the Space Shuttle, on STS-2 (the other person beingFrederick W. Sturckow). Engle manually flew large numbers of flight-test maneuvers on the Shuttle during reentry and landing; periods of manually flown test maneuvers were interspersed with periods of computer control.[14][17]
He served as deputy associate administrator for manned space flight at NASA Headquarters from March to December 1982.[1]He retained his astronaut flight status and returned toJohnson Space Centerin January 1983.[1]He also participated in theChallengerdisasterinvestigation in 1986, and did other consulting work on the Shuttle well into the 1990s.[18]

Post-NASA career
Engle retired from the USAF with the rank ofcolonelon November 14, 1986, and from NASA on November 28, 1986.[19][20]On December 1, 1986, he was appointed by theGovernor of Kansasand theUnited States Secretary of the Air Forceto a billet in theKansas Air National Guardat the rank ofbrigadier general, initially serving as a special assistant to theadjutant general. Under this arrangement, Engle was permitted to retain Houston residency.[19][21]The discrepancy between his Air Force and Air National Guard ranks was rectified by Senate confirmation of his promotion on February 2, 1988.[22]He subsequently served asAir National Guardassistant to the commander in chief,United States Space CommandandNorth American Air Defense Command(NORAD), with headquarters atPeterson Air Force Base,Colorado. Engle ultimately retired from the Air National Guard around 1991 at the rank ofmajor general, a promotion previously confirmed by the Senate on June 22, 1989.[23][24]
In 1992, he was inducted into theAerospace Walk of Honor.[25]In 2001, Engle was inducted into theNational Aviation Hall of Fameand theU.S. Astronaut Hall of Fame.[26][27]
