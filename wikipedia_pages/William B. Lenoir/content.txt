William Benjamin Lenoir(March 14, 1939 – August 26, 2010) was an Americanelectrical engineerandNASAastronaut.

Early life and education
William Benjamin Lenoir was born on March 14, 1939, inMiami, Florida, as a son of Samuel Staples Lenoir (1910–1989) and Iona Catherine Lenoir (néeYann; 1915–1977). He attended Coral Gables Elementary School, Ponce de Leon Junior High School,[1]and graduated fromCoral Gables Senior High Schoolin 1957.[2]He graduated with aBachelor of Sciencedegree inelectrical engineeringfrom theMassachusetts Institute of Technologyin 1961, where he was an active member ofSigma Alpha Epsilon(SAE). Lenoir continued at MIT, earning aMaster of Sciencedegree in 1962, and aDoctor of Philosophydegree inEECSin 1965.[3]While working for his doctoral degree, Lenoir received an award for excelling at teaching undergraduate courses.[4]
From 1964 to 1965, Lenoir was an instructor at MIT; and in 1965, he was namedassociate professorof electrical engineering.[5]His work at MIT included teachingelectromagnetic theoryandsystems theory, as well as performing research inremote sensing.[6]He was an investigator in several satellite experiments and continued research in this area while fulfilling his astronaut assignments.[6]

NASA career
Lenoir was working on Apollo Applications experiments at MIT when he saw an advertisement in a science magazine recruiting NASA astronauts.[7]He sent in an application and was selected as a scientist-astronaut by NASA in August 1967.[8]He completed the initial academic training and a 53-week course in flight training atLaughlin Air Force Base,Texas.[9]He received his wings with distinguished graduate honors in April 1969.[10]
Lenoir was backup science pilot forSkylab 3andSkylab 4, the second and third crewed missions in theSkylabprogram.[11]During Skylab 4, he was co-leader of the visual observations project and coordinator between the flight crew and the principal investigators for the solar science experiments.
From September 1974 to July 1976, Lenoir spent approximately one-half of his time as leader of the NASA Satellite Power Team. This team was formed to investigate the potential of large-scale satellite power systems for terrestrial utility consumption and to make program recommendations toNASA Headquarters. Lenoir supported theSpace Shuttle programin the areas of orbit operations, training,extravehicular activity, andpayloaddeployment and retrieval.[3]
Lenoir flew as amission specialistonSTS-5(November 11–16, 1982), the first Space Shuttle flight to deploy commercial satellites, and logged over 122 hours inspace.[12]Following STS-5, Lenoir was responsible for the direction and management of mission development within theAstronaut Office.
Lenoir resigned from NASA in September 1984, to assume a position with the management and technology consulting firm ofBooz Allen HamiltoninArlington, Virginia.[13]He returned to NASA in June 1989 as the Associate Administrator for Space Flight, responsible for the development, operating and implementation of the necessary policy for the Space Shuttle and all U.S. government civil launch activities.[12][14][15]
Lenoir resigned from NASA again in April 1992,[16]to becomevice presidentof the Applied Systems Division at Booz Allen Hamilton inBethesda, Maryland.[12]

Spaceflight experience
STS-5launched fromKennedy Space Center,Florida, on November 11, 1982. This was the first operational flight of theSpace ShuttleColumbiaand became known as the "We Deliver" mission.[17]Two commercial communications satellites with Payload Assist Module upper stages (PAM-D) were successfully deployed from the Orbiter's cargo bay, a new first. This activity was shared with the world when the onboard television tape was played to the control center later that evening. In addition to collecting precise data to document the Shuttle's performance during launch, boost, orbit, atmospheric entry and landing phases, STS-5 carried a Getaway Special experiment, three Student Involvement Project experiments, and medical experiments. STS-5 was the last flight to carry the Development Flight Instrumentation (DFI) package to support flight testing.[18]
Lenoir andAllenwere to perform a spacewalk, the first of the Shuttle program, to test newly developed space suits. The space suits were developed as cheaper and less complicated alternatives to the Apollo versions. The test was delayed by one day due to Lenoir succumbing to motion sickness.[19]Then an underperforming oxygen regulator in Lenoir's suit caused them to cancel the extravehicular activity (EVA) entirely.[20]It was the first time in the history of the space program that an EVA had been cancelled due to space suit issues.[21]
The STS-5 crew successfully concluded the 5-day orbital flight ofColumbiawith the first entry and landing through a cloud deck to a hard-surface runway, demonstrating maximum braking. STS-5 completed 81 orbits of theEarthbefore landing atEdwards Air Force Base,California, on November 16, 1982.[22]

Personal life
Lenoir was married twice.[23]He had three children.[24]
Lenoir logged over 3,000 hours of flying time injet aircraft.[12]

Death
Lenoir died August 26, 2010, after suffering head injuries during a bicycle accident[25]near his home inSandoval County, New Mexico.[26]

Organizations
Lenoir was a senior member of theInstitute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers, and a member of theAmerican Institute of Aeronautics and Astronautics,Eta Kappa Nuand the Society ofSigma Xi.[27]

Honors and awards
Lenoir received a number of honors. He was a Sloan Scholar at theMassachusetts Institute of Technology, winner of the Carleton E. Tucker Award for Teaching Excellence atMIT, and recipient of theNASA Exceptional Service Medal(1974) andNASA Space Flight Medal(1982).[27]
