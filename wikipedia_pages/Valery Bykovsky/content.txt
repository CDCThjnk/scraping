Valery Fyodorovich Bykovsky(Russian:Вале́рий Фёдорович Быко́вский; 2 August 1934 – 27 March 2019) was a Sovietcosmonautwho flew on three space flights:Vostok 5,Soyuz 22, andSoyuz 31. He was also backup forVostok 3andSoyuz 37.

Early life and career
Born inPavlovsky Posad, Russia, on 2 August 1934, Bykovsky was the son of Fyodor Fyodorovich Bykovsky and Klavdia Ivanova. He had an older sister named Margarita, born three years earlier. When he was four years old,World War IIbegan, forcing the family to move toKuybyshev, and later again toSyzran, before moving back to nearMoscow.[1]By the age of 14, Bykovsky wanted to attend naval school; however, his father was not a proponent of this idea and encouraged him to stay at his school. A few days later, Bykovsky attended a lecture on the Soviet Air Force Club which inspired him to pursue his dream of becoming a pilot. He began flight theory lessons when he was 16 at the Moscow City Aviation Club.[1]
Bykovsky graduated from aviation school aged 18 and enrolled in the Kachinsk Military Aviation Academy.[1]He served as a fighter pilot and later as an instructor pilot, training other pilots on fighter aircraft. During his military service, Bykovsky logged over 5,000 hours of flying time on various types of aircraft, including jet fighters and bombers.[2]
Bykovsky also had a passion for aviation research and experimentation. He was involved in several research programs aimed at improving the performance and safety of military aircraft. One of the programs he participated in was the development of theTupolev Tu-16jet bomber, which was used by the Soviet Air Force from the 1950s to the 1980s. Bykovsky was also involved in the testing of new jet engines and aviation equipment. In the 1950s, he participated in the testing of theMikoyan-Gurevich MiG-19jet fighter, which was the first Soviet production aircraft capable of supersonic flight.[2]
He graduated from the academy at 21 years old and received the rank of lieutenant. By the time he began his cosmonaut training, he had done over 72 parachute jumps.[1]

Cosmonaut career

Vostok programme
At 26 years old, he started his cosmonaut training at Zhukovsky Military Engineering academy.[1]Although an exceptional pilot in his own right Bykovsky was not part of the original "Vanguard Six" assigned to the Vostok mission, however, due to a back injury sustained by Valentin Varlamov, Bykovksy was added to the group.[3]His first assignment was as the backup pilot to theVostok 3mission.[4]
He launched on theVostok 5mission fromBaikonur Cosmodromein Kazakhstan on 14 June 1963.[5]During the flight he conducted experiments, such as photographing the Earth's horizon and documenting the growth of peas. He also floated about in the cabin and adjusted the spacecraft orientation numerous times.[5]Two days into his flight,Valentina Tereshkovaflew theVostok 6spacecraft within five kilometres of Bykovsky's.[6]Bykovsky set a space endurance record of five days in orbit[7]where his call-sign was "Hawk" (Russian: Ястреб).[8]Although this duration has been surpassed by multi-crew flights, it remains the record for a solo spaceflight.[9]He also performed the first human bowel movement in space, at 9 hours and 5 minutes into the mission.[10]
He was given his nation's highest honour, "Hero of The Soviet Union" for his contribution to Soviet spaceflight.[11][6]During his Vostok 5 mission, Bykovsky was also made a member of the Communist Party.[1]He was promoted to colonel on 30 April 1966.[12]
On June 25, 1963, Bykovsky and Tereshkova went to Moscow University for a press conference[5]where Bykovsky was quoted byThe Timesdescribing how weightlessness affected him: "The muscles of the arms feel extremely light; you lift a hand without any effort, you pick up something-and it weighs nothing. You get accustomed to this, but not at once."[5]

Soyuz programme
Bykovsky was assigned to be the commander of the originalSoyuz 2mission, which was planned to be launched soon afterSoyuz 1. Two of the three crewmen from Soyuz 2 were to conduct an extravehicular activity (EVA) and enter Soyuz 1. During the Soyuz 1 flight, many concurrent problems forced mission control to command an early reentry of the spacecraft. This also caused them to cancel the Soyuz 2 flight as no rendezvous could occur. On Soyuz 1, tube holding the main parachute was too rough, which created enough friction that thedrogue parachutewas unable to pull it out. The spacecraft struck the ground at approximately 93 miles per hour, killingVladimir Komarov. As the Soyuz 2 capsule was made with the same specifications as Soyuz 1, if the mission had flown Bykovsky and his crew would have been killed.[13]
He flew theSoyuz 22mission withVladimir Aksyonov. The mission launched on 15 September 1976. The capsule was originally a backup for theApollo–Soyuz Test Project(ASTP). The main purpose of the mission was studying and practising Earth observation techniques.[14]
He flew theSoyuz 31mission to theSalyut 6space station with the East GermanSigmund Jähn. It was launched on 26 August 1978. They joined two other cosmonauts on the space station that had arrived onSoyuz 29. The four conducted biological experiments on themselves during their stay. Bykovsky and Jähn undocked from the station in the Soyuz 29 capsule on 3 September and landed back on Earth later that day.[15]: 111

Post-cosmonaut career
Much of his later career was devoted to promoting theIntercosmosprogramme amongst the world'ssocialistnations. Due to his age, he was moved from active duty to the reserves in 1988.[16]He became the director of the Centre of Soviet Science and Culture inEast Berlinafter the Soyuz 31 mission.[17]He retired sometime in 1990.[18]
Valery Bykovsky established the Russian Federation of Cosmonautics (RFC) in 1998 with the objective of advancing the development of space exploration and science in Russia. The RFC's main goals included increasing public interest in space exploration, providing educational opportunities for young people, and supporting research and development initiatives in the space sector. Bykovsky was the president of the RFC until his death in 2019.[19]

Personal life
Bykovsky was a keen sportsman:
Service in the Air Force made us strong, both physically and morally. All of us cosmonauts took up sports and PT seriously when we served in the Air Force. I know thatYuri Gagarinwas fond ofice hockey. He liked to play goal keeper.Gherman Titovwas agymnasticsenthusiast,Andriyan Nikolayevlikedskiing,Pavel Popovichwent in for weight lifting. I don't think I am wrong when I say that sports became a fixture in the life of the cosmonauts.[20]
Bykovsky was a proficient aesthete and photographer who evinced a particular penchant for the art of painting.[3]His extensive body of work, characterized by a predominantly figurative style, has been widely showcased in renowned galleries and museums throughout Russia.  Additionally, he had an abiding passion for photography and had taken numerous photographs during his space missions, using both conventional and digital cameras to capture stunning images of the Earth's surface and the celestial bodies.[21]
He was married to Valentina Mikhailovna Sukhova; they had two sons.[22]In 1986, his first son died in an aviation incident.[18]Valery Bykovsky died on 27 March 2019.[9][22]
