Early years
Laliberté was born in 1959[6]inQuebec City,Quebec, Canada.

Barnum.[7]While he was still in school, he produced several performing arts events.[8]
After school, Laliberté left Canada to hitchhike around Europe at the age of 18. While travelling, he made money by playing the accordion.

The group obtained the support of a government grant for the celebration of the 450th anniversary ofJacques Cartier's discovery of Canada.[11]Cirque du Soleil was originally set up as a one-year project. However, the government of Quebec wanted a touring event that would perform in other provinces. The name 'Cirque du Soleil' ("circus of the sun"), which Laliberté came up with while he was inHawaii, reflects his notion that "the sun stands for energy and youth" and that the circus is about those two words.[11]
Cirque du Soleil now has activities on five continents.[6]Its shows employ approximately 4,000 people from over 40 countries and generate an estimated annual revenue exceedingUS$810 million.[12][13]

"Because of all that's happening in the world, I said to myself: that could be the place where, in case of an epidemic or a total war, I could bring people I like and my family so that we'd be protected. It will be completely autonomous in terms of operation: solar, environmental, ecologic, all that."[22]
