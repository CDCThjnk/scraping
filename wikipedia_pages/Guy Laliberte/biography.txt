Along with Gilles Ste-Croix , he is the co-founder of Cirque du Soleil , which was founded in 1984. The Canadian circus company's shows have since been seen by more than 90 million people worldwide. Before founding the company, he had busked , performing as an accordion player, stiltwalker , and fire-eater .
- In 2006, he was named the Ernst & Young Canadian Entrepreneur of the Year. In 2007, he was named Ernst & Young World Entrepreneur of the Year . In January 2018, Laliberté was ranked by Forbes as the 11th-wealthiest Canadian.
- Laliberté was born in 1959 in Quebec City , Quebec , Canada. His interest in show business began when his parents took him to watch the Ringling Brothers and Barnum & Bailey Circus , an experience which led him to read the biography of P. T. Barnum . While he was still in school, he produced several performing arts events.
- After school, Laliberté left Canada to hitchhike around Europe at the age of 18. While travelling, he made money by playing the accordion. He also learned fire-eating and stilt-walking during his time abroad, and after returning to Canada, became a street performer on the streets of Quebec. Laliberté joined a performing troupe called Les Échassiers, which included fire-breathers, jugglers, and acrobats who hitchhiked around the country to shows.

- Laliberté co-founded Cirque du Soleil in 1984 with Gilles Ste-Croix and a small group of colleagues. The group obtained the support of a government grant for the celebration of the 450th anniversary of Jacques Cartier 's discovery of Canada. Cirque du Soleil was originally set up as a one-year project. However, the government of Quebec wanted a touring event that would perform in other provinces. The name 'Cirque du Soleil' ("circus of the sun"), which Laliberté came up with while he was in Hawaii , reflects his notion that "the sun stands for energy and youth" and that the circus is about those two words.

It will be completely autonomous in terms of operation: solar, environmental, ecologic, all that."
