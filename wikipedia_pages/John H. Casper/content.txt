John Howard Casper(born July 9, 1943) is a former Americanastronautand retiredUnited States Air Forcepilot.

Early life and education
Although born on July 9, 1943, inGreenville, South Carolina, Casper considersGainesville, Georgiato be his hometown.[1]He was active in theBoy Scouts of Americaand achieved its second-highest rank,Life Scout.
He graduated with aBachelor of Sciencedegree inEngineering Sciencefrom theUnited States Air Force Academyin 1966, and aMaster of Sciencedegree inAstronauticsfromPurdue Universityin 1967.[1]

Military career
Before he was an astronaut, Casper was aUnited States Air Force(USAF)fighter pilot, earning hispilot wingsatReese Air Force Base,Texas. AfterF-100 Super Sabretraining atLuke Air Force Base,Arizona, he flew 229combat missionswith the35th Tactical Fighter Wingin theVietnam War. Following his tour in Vietnam, Casper flew F-100 andF-4 Phantomaircraft while assigned to the48th Tactical Fighter Wing,Royal Air Force Lakenheath, United Kingdom.[1]
Casper was selected to attend theU.S. Air Force Test Pilot SchoolatEdwards Air Force Base,California, and graduated with class 74A.[2]After graduating he became Chief of the F-4 Test Team; he flew initial performance and weapons separation tests for the F-4GWild Weaselaircraft and avionics tests for F-4E andA-7 Corsair IIaircraft. Casper then became operations officer and later commander of the6513th Test Squadron, where he conducted flight test programs to evaluate and develop tactical aircraft weapons systems. He was then assigned to Headquarters, USAF atthe Pentagonand was Deputy Chief of the Special Projects Office, where he developed USAF positions on requirements, operational concepts, policy and force structure for tactical and strategic programs.[1]
Colonel Casper has logged over 10,000 flying hours in 52 different aircraft.[3]

NASA astronaut
Selected byNASAin May 1984, Casper became an astronaut in June 1985. A veteran of four space flights, he has logged over 825 hours in space.[4]He was the pilot on missionSTS-36, and spacecraft commander on missionsSTS-54,STS-62andSTS-77. His technical assignments while assigned to the Astronaut Office included Chief of the Operations Development Branch; lead for improvements to the nosewheel steering, brakes, tires, and development of a landing drag chute; astronaut team leader for theShuttle Avionics Integration Laboratory(SAIL); and ascent/entry spacecraft communicator (CAPCOM) in theMission Control Center.

Space flights
STS-36launched from theKennedy Space Center,Florida, on February 28, 1990, aboardSpace ShuttleAtlantis. This mission carried classifiedDepartment of Defensepayloads and was unique in that it flew at 62 degrees inclination, the highest inclination flown to date by the U.S. human space flight program. After 72 orbits of the Earth, the STS-36 mission concluded with a lakebed landing atEdwards Air Force Base, California, on March 4, 1990, after traveling 1.87 million miles. Mission duration was 106 hours, 19 minutes, 43 seconds.[5]
STS-54launched from the Kennedy Space Center, Florida, on January 13, 1993, aboardSpace ShuttleEndeavour. A crew of five successfully accomplished the primary objectives of this six-day mission, including deploying a $200 million NASATracking and Data Relay Satellite(TDRS-F), which joined four other satellites to complete a national communications network supporting Space Shuttle and other low-Earth orbit scientific satellites. A Diffuse X-Ray Spectrometer (DXS) carried in the payload bay collected X-ray data to enable investigators to answer questions about the origin of X-rays in theMilky Way galaxy. A highly successful extravehicular activity (EVA) resulted in many lessons learned that benefited the International Space Station assembly. The flight was also the first to shut down and restart a fuel cell in flight, successfully demonstrating another Space Station application. Casper landedEndeavourat the Kennedy Space Center on January 19, 1993, after 96 Earth orbits covering over 2.5 million miles. Mission duration was 143 hours and 38 minutes.[6]
STS-62(March 4–18, 1994) was a two-week microgravity research mission aboardSpace ShuttleColumbia. Its primary payloads were the United States Microgravity Payload (USMP-2) and the Office of Aeronautics and Space Technology (OAST-2) payloads. These payloads included experiments to understand the process of semiconductor crystal growth, investigating the process of metal alloys as they solidify, studying materials at their critical point (where they exist as both a liquid and gas), and testing new technology for use on future spacecraft, such as advanced solar arrays, radiators, heat sinks, and radiation shielding. The flight also tested new technology for aligning theRemote Manipulator Systemarm and for grasping payloads with a new magnetic end effector.Columbiaflew at a record low altitude of 195 km (105 nautical miles) to gather data on spacecraft glow and erosion caused by atomic oxygen and nitrogen molecules. Casper landedColumbiaat the Kennedy Space Center after 224 Earth orbits and 5.82 million miles.[7]
STS-77(May 19–29, 1996) was a ten-day mission aboard Space ShuttleEndeavour. The crew performed a record number of rendezvous sequences (one with a SPARTAN satellite and three with a deployed Satellite Test Unit) and approximately 21 hours of formation flying in close proximity of the satellites. During the flight the crew also conducted 12 experiments in materials processing, fluid physics and biotechnology in aSpacehabModule. STS-77 deployed and retrieved a SPARTAN satellite, which carried the Inflatable Antenna Experiment designed to test the concept of large, inflatable space structures. A small Satellite Test Unit was also deployed to test the concept of self-stabilization by using aerodynamic forces and magnetic damping. Casper broughtEndeavourback to Earth at the Kennedy Space Center after 160 Earth orbits and 4.1 million miles. Mission duration was 240 hours and 39 minutes.[8]

Post-flight Career
Following his last Shuttle mission, Colonel Casper has served in positions of increasing responsibility in NASA. He was Director of Safety, Reliability, and Quality Assurance at theJohnson Space Center, where he was responsible for all safety, reliability and quality activities for JSC's human spaceflight programs, including theInternational Space Station, theSpace Shuttle,Space Launch Initiative, andCrew Return Vehicles. He also was responsible for planning, directing and implementing an effective institutional safety program to prevent injuries, loss of life, or loss of capital assets.[3]
After theColumbiadisasterin February 2003, Casper became the NASA Mishap Investigation Team's deputy for the debris recovery operation, which involved directing the efforts of over 6,000 ground, air, and water search personnel, as well as protection and impoundment of debris. He was Co-Chair of the Return-To-Flight Planning Team, a NASA Headquarters-chartered independent team charged with addressing all actions necessary to comply with theColumbia Accident Investigation Boardrecommendations.[9]He then joined theSpace Shuttle programand became Manager of the Management Integration and Planning Office, responsible for Return-to-Flight planning and management integration across all program elements. Casper is currently Associate Manager of the Space Shuttle Program, assisting the program manager in the management, integration, and operations of the program.[3]
In 2022, Casper published an autobiography of his experience in space titledThe Sky Above: An Astronaut’s Memoir of Adventure, Persistence, and Faith.[10]

Honors
Colonel Casper has been awarded theDefense Superior Service Medal, twoLegion of MeritAwards, twoDistinguished Flying Crosses, 11Air Medals, twoDefense Meritorious Service Medals, sixAir Force Commendation Medals, theVietnam Cross of Gallantry, twoNASA Distinguished Service Medals, theNASA Outstanding Leadership Medal, theNASA Exceptional Service Medal, fourNASA Space Flight Medals, and theNational Intelligence Medal of Achievement.[3]
