Cosmonaut career
Lonchakov was selected as a test-cosmonaut candidate of theGagarin Cosmonaut Training CenterCosmonaut Office in December 1997. In July 2004 he took part in the training for survival in extreme situations at theBaikonur Cosmodrome.

STS-100
Lonchakov's first spaceflight was theSpace ShuttlemissionSTS-100that installed theInternational Space Station's robotic arm,Canadarm2. Other major objectives forEndeavour'smission were to berth theRaffaellologistics module to the station, activate it, transfer cargo betweenRaffaelloand the station, and reberthRaffaelloin the shuttle's payload bay. Space ShuttleEndeavourlifted off from theKennedy Space Centerat 18:40:42 UTC on 19 April 2001.[5]Lonchakov served as a mission specialist. After nearly two days of flight,Endeavourdocked with the ISS on 21 April 2001 at 13:59 UTC. After 8 days of docked operations, the shuttle undocked from the ISS at 17:34 UTC on 19 April. Landing was originally planned at KSC however continuing cloud cover, rain showers and gusty winds forcedEndeavourto land atEdwards Air Force Basein California.[6]The mission duration of STS-100 was 11 days, 21 hours, 31 minutes, 14 seconds.

Soyuz TMA-1/TM-34
On 25 March 2002, Lonchakov passed training for a spaceflight as the backup crew commander of theSoyuz-TM,Soyuz-TMAspacecraft, 4th visiting crew under the ISS program. On 1 October 2002, he was selected for the prime crew as flight engineer-2 and remained the backup crew commander.
Lonchakov returned to the ISS in October 2002 as a crewmember of the Soyuz taxi flightSoyuz TMA-1. The Soyuz spacecraft carrying commander Lonchakov, flight engineer cosmonautSergei Zalyotinand ESA astronautFrank De Winnelifted off from the Baikonour Cosmodrome on 30 October 2002, at 03:11 UTC. Thick fog on the ground obscured the launch from the cameras, which showed only a silhouette of the rocket and the flame exhaust.[7]The successful docking between the Soyuz TMA-1 and the ISS did take place at 05:01 UTC on 1 November 2002. After spending 10 days, 20 hours and 53 minutes in space Lonchakov returned to Earth onSoyuz TM-34.[1]TheSoyuz TM-34spacecraft, undocked from the nadir port of theZaryamodule of the ISS on 9 November at 20:44 GMT and landed 100 km north east ofArkalykon 10 November 2002 at 00:04 UTC.[8]Soyuz TM-34 was the last of the Soyuz-TM spacecraft and was replaced by the Soyuz-TMA.

Expedition 18
Lonchakov was originally selected to be a flight engineer onExpedition 19, but was transferred to theExpedition 18crew as a flight engineer and Soyuz commander, afterSalizhan Sharipovwas removed from the crew.[9]TheSoyuz TMA-13spacecraft with Lonchakov, Expedition 18 commanderMichael Finckeand space touristRichard Garriottlaunched on 12 October 2008 at 7:01 UTC.[10][11]Lonchakov served as the Soyuz commander. After a two-day autonomous flight, Soyuz TMA-13 successfully docked to the Earth-facing docking port of theZaryamodule of the ISS on 14 October at 08:26 GMT, seven minutes ahead of schedule. Lonchakov joined the ISS Expedition 18 crew as a flight engineer. While Richard Garriott was aboard, Lonchakov participated during his personal time (along with Michael Fincke,Gregory Chamitoffand Richard Garriott) in filming and starring in a science-fiction movie made in space,Apogee of Fear.
On 12 March 2009, a piece ofdebrisfrom theupper stageof aDelta IIrocket used to launch aGPS satellitein 1993, passed close to the ISS. The Expedition 18 crew prepared to evacuate the ISS by closing hatches between modules, and boarding the Soyuz spacecraft that was docked to provide emergency crew escape.[12]The debris did not hit the space station and safely passed by at 16:38 UTC, and the crew were cleared to resume operations about five minutes later.[12]
Lonchakov returned to Earth with NASA astronaut Michael Fincke and spaceflight participantCharles Simonyi. The Soyuz TMA-13 capsule landed in Kazakhstan on 8 April 2009, at 7:16 UTC.

Spacewalks
Lonchakov has performed two career spacewalks totalling 10 hours and 27 minutes.
On 23 December 2008, Lonchakov performed his first career spacewalk with NASA astronaut Michael Fincke.[13]They installed an electromagnetic energy measuring device, (Langmuir probe) onPirs, removed the Russian Biorisk long-duration experiment, installed the Exposing Specimens of Organic and Biological Materials to Open Space (Expose-R) experiment package onZvezda, but subsequently removed it after it failed to activate and transmit telemetry on ground command. The two spacewalkers also installed the Impulse experiment which measures disturbances in the ionosphere around the space station. The EVA was conducted fromPirsairlock in RussianOrlan space suits.[14][15]The spacewalk lasted 5 hours and 38 minutes.
On 10 March 2009, Lonchakov performed his second career spacewalk, again with Fincke. The two spacewalkers installed the EXPOSE-R experiment onto the universal science platform of theZvezdamodule, removed tape straps from the area of the docking target on thePirsairlock and docking compartment, inspected and photographed the exterior of the Russian portion of the station.[16]The spacewalk was conducted fromPirsDocking Compartment airlock in Russian Orlan space suits.[17]and came to a close at 21:11 UTC when the airlock hatch was closed. The spacewalk lasted 4 hours and 49 minutes and marked the 120th spacewalk in support of space station assembly and maintenance.

Resignation
In 2013, he submitted his resignation, effective 14 September. It was announced that he was resigning for a more interesting job. Lonchakov had been scheduled to fly onExpedition 44to the International Space Station, and at the time of announcement, no replacement had been named.[18]Gennady Padalka will be his replacement.

Post-space career
Lonchakov resigned from the cosmonaut corps and took up a position atGazprom. On 31 March 2014 he was appointed acting head ofGCTC.[citation needed]
