Borisenko served as a flight engineer on boardSoyuz TMA-21forExpedition 27, the 27th long-duration mission to theInternational Space Station(ISS). He also served as the commander of theInternational Space StationforExpedition 28. He launched for the second time in October 2016 onboardSoyuz MS-02as a flight engineer ofExpedition 49andExpedition 50. He returned to Earth in April 2017.

Personal life
Borisenko is married to Natalya Aleksandrovna Borisenko.[2]They have two children. His parents, Ivan Andreevich and Natalya Mikhailovna Borisenko, live in St Petersburg.
In 2018, in an exhibition on space at theLycée International de Saint-Germain-en-Layeorganised by the Russian Section, he lent his suit for display.

Education
Borisenko graduated from theLeningrad Physics and Mathematics School #30in 1981. He then entered the Leningrad Military Mechanical Institute and graduated in 1987 with the qualification "Flight and Control Dynamics".[2]

Experience
Following graduation from the institute Borisenko worked for a military unit from 1987–1989. In 1989, he started working atRSC Energiawhere he was responsible for theMirmotion control system and took part in the Mission Control Center - Moscow (MCC-M) on board systems operation analysis board. In 1999, Borisenko was a shift flight director at the MCC-M, first for the Mir space station and then for theInternational Space Station(ISS).[2]

Cosmonaut career
Borisenko was selected as a cosmonaut candidate from RSC Energia on 29 May 2003.[3]He started basic spaceflight training in June 2003 and completed it in June 2005 by passing the state exams with excellent grades. He received qualification of test-cosmonaut on 5 July 2005 from the Interdepartmental Qualification Commission. From July 2005 to August 2008 he participated in advanced space flight training.
For his first assignment he was assigned as backup ISS flight engineer and Soyuz commander forExpedition 24/25, although due to crew rearrangements he was moved forward to the backup crew for ISSExpedition 23/24, training as backup ISS flight engineer and Commander and Soyuz flight engineer.[4]

Expedition 27/28
Following the launch of ISS Expedition 23/24 onSoyuz TMA-18in April 2010, Borisenko was released from his duties on the flight's backup crew and assigned to the prime crew ofExpedition 27/28, as flight engineer on Expedition 27 and commander on Expedition 28. He and his two crewmates, Soyuz commanderAleksandr Samokutyayevof Roscosmos and NASA astronautRonald Garan, launched aboardSoyuz TMA-21from theBaikonur Cosmodrome'sGagarin's Startlaunch pad, at 23:18:20 UTC on 4 April 2011. The launch of Soyuz TMA-21 was dedicated to the 50th anniversary of the first crewed space flight byYuri Gagarinperformed in 1961.[5]After 2 days of autonomous flight, the Soyuz TMA-21 spacecraft docked with theInternational Space Station(ISS) on April 6 at 23:09 UTC, with the crew officially joining the crew of Expedition 27, alongside Russian commanderDmitri Kondratyev, NASA astronautCatherine ColemanandItalianastronautPaolo Nespoli.[6]
On 22 May 2011 Kondratyev officially handed over command to Borisenko, with Expedition 27 officially ending with the departure ofSoyuz TMA-20, carrying Kondratyev, Coleman and Nespoli back to Earth on 24 May 2011.[7]The Expedition 28 crew would soon be joined by the crew ofSoyuz TMA-02M, carrying Russian cosmonautSergey Volkov,JAXAastronautSatoshi Furukawaand NASA astronautMike Fossum.[8]
Borisenko concluded his stay aboard the ISS, when his spaceship, Soyuz TMA-21 undocked from the Russian segment's Poisk module at 00:38 UTC on September 16,.[9]On the same day, the Soyuz TMA-21 capsule carrying Borisenko and his two crew mates, Alexander Samokutyaev and Ron Garan touched down (3:59:39 UTC) at 93 miles southeast of the city ofZhezkazganin Kazakhstan.[10]During the Soyuz re-entry, repeated calls to the spacecraft from the Russian Mission Control in Korolyov, near Moscow, went unanswered for several minutes. Communication was eventually established between the crew and a plane circling the landing site.
On the ground, Borisenko appeared to be in good spirits as he flashed up an enthusiastic "thumbs-up" signal shortly after he was pulled out of the Soyuz landing capsule. He and his colleagues were carried on their chairs to a makeshift inflatable hospital for further medical check ups. After attending the traditional greeting ceremony at the airport inKaraganda, Kazakhstan, Borisenko boarded a plane to return to the training base in Star City, Russia.

Expedition 49/50
Borisenko launched for a second time on 19 October 2016 aboardSoyuz MS-02as Flight Engineer,[11]launch was originally scheduled for 23 September although was delayed due to technical issues with the spacecraft.[12]
Borisenko and his two crew mates, Roscosmos cosmonautSergey Ryzhikovand NASA astronautShane Kimbroughrendezvoused and docked to the ISS on the 21st of October following a two-day rendezvous, and officially joined theExpedition 49alongside Russian commanderAnatoly Ivanishinand flight engineersTakuya OnishiofJAXAandKathleen Rubinsof NASA. Due to month long launch delay Soyuz MS-02 faced, the hand over period was short, Expedition 49 ended on 30 October 2016 when Ivanishin, Onishi and Rubins returned to Earth aboardSoyuz MS-01, leaving the MS-02 trio on board the ISS asExpedition 50with Kimbrough taking command.[13]
The rest of the Expedition 50 crew joined Borisenko and his two crew mates on 19 November 2016 whenSoyuz MS-03, carrying Russian cosmonautOleg Novitsky,FrenchastronautThomas Pesquet, and NASA astronautPeggy Whitsondocked to the station.[14]During the Expedition theRussian Orbital Segmentof the ISS was supposed to welcome theProgress MS-04uncrewed resupply spacecraft, although the spacecraft failed to reach the ISS due to an issue with theSoyuz-Ulaunch vehicle's third stage which shutdown sooner than intended.[15]Progress flights quickly resumed during Expedition 50, with the launch ofProgress MS-05in February 2017.[16]
Borisenko continued to work as a flight engineer with the Expedition 50 crew until 10 April 2017, when he, Ryzhikov and Kimbrough un-docked from the ISS, officially ending Expedition 50 and startingExpedition 51. The trio safely landed on theKazakh Steppeless than five hours later, wrapping up a 173-day spaceflight and bringing Borisenko's total time in space to 337 days.[17]
