Sally Kristen Ride(May 26, 1951 – July 23, 2012) was an Americanastronautandphysicist. Born inLos Angeles, she joinedNASAin 1978, and in 1983 became the first American woman and the third woman to fly inspace, aftercosmonautsValentina Tereshkovain 1963 andSvetlana Savitskayain 1982. She was the youngest American astronaut to have flown in space, having done so at the age of 32.
Ride was a graduate ofStanford University, where she earned a Bachelor of Science degree in physics and a Bachelor of Arts degree in English literature in 1973, a Master of Science degree in 1975, and a Doctor of Philosophy in 1978 (both in physics) for research on the interaction ofX-rayswith the interstellar medium. She was selected as amission specialistastronaut withNASA Astronaut Group 8, the first class of NASA astronauts to include women. After completing her training in 1979, she served as the ground-basedcapsule communicator(CapCom) for the second and thirdSpace Shuttleflights, and helped develop the Space Shuttle'srobotic arm. In June 1983, she flew in space on theSpace ShuttleChallengeron theSTS-7mission. The mission deployed two communications satellites and the firstShuttle pallet satellite(SPAS-1). Ride operated the robotic arm to deploy and retrieve SPAS-1. Her second space flight was theSTS-41-Gmission in 1984, also on boardChallenger. She spent a total of more than 343 hours in space. She left NASA in 1987.
Ride worked for two years at Stanford University'sCenter for International Security and Arms Control, then at theUniversity of California, San Diego, primarily researchingnonlinear opticsandThomson scattering. She served on the committees that investigated theloss ofChallengerandofColumbia, the only person to participate in both. Having been married to astronautSteven Hawleyduring her spaceflight years and in a private, long-term relationship with formerWomen's Tennis AssociationplayerTam O'Shaughnessy, she is the first astronaut known to have beenLGBTQ, a fact that she hid until her death, when her obituary identified O'Shaughnessy as her partner of 27 years.[1]She died ofpancreatic cancerin 2012.

Early life
Sally Kristen Ride was born on May 26, 1951, in theEncinoneighborhood of Los Angeles, California,[2][3]: 6the elder child of Dale Burdell Ride and Carol Joyce RidenéeAnderson.[3]: 4–6She had one sibling, Karen, known as "Bear".[3]: 7–8[4]Both parents wereeldersin thePresbyterian Church. Her mother, who was of Norwegian descent, had worked as a volunteer counselor at a women's correctional facility.[5]Her father served with theU.S. Armyin Europe with the103rd Infantry DivisionduringWorld War II. After the war he went toHaverford Collegeon theG.I. Bill, earned a master's degree in education at theUniversity of California, Los Angeles,[3]: 4–6and became a political science professor atSanta Monica College.[5]
Ride grew up in theVan Nuysand Encino neighborhoods of Los Angeles. In 1960, when she was nine years old, the family spent a year traveling in Europe. In Spain, Ride played tennis for the first time.[3]: 12–15She enjoyed sports, tennis most of all, and at age 10 was coached byAlice Marble, a former world number one player.[6]By 1963 Ride was ranked number 20 in Southern California for girls aged 12 and under.[3]: 22She attended Encino Elementary School, Portola Junior High (nowPortola Middle School),Birmingham High Schooland then, as asophomoreon a tennis scholarship,Westlake School for Girls, an exclusive all-girls private school in Los Angeles.[5][3]: 19–22Elizabeth Mommaerts, who taught human physiology, became a mentor. Ride resolved to become anastrophysicist.[7]She graduated in June 1968, and then took a class in advanced math at Santa Monica College during the summer break.[3]: 30–31
Her friend Sue Okie was interested in going toSwarthmore Collegein Pennsylvania, so Ride applied too. She was interviewed byFred Hargadon, the dean of admissions, who was impressed by both her mental and her tennis ability. She was admitted on a full scholarship.[3]: 28–29She commenced classes at Swarthmore on September 18, 1968. She played golf, and made Swarthmore'sfield hockeyvarsity team. She won all six of her intercollegiate tennis matches, and became the Eastern Intercollegiate Women's Singles champion. She defended her title in May 1969, winning instraight sets. However, Ride was homesick for California, and, beforeTitle IX, women's tennis was not well-supported at the college level; Swarthmore had four tennis courts but no indoor courts and she could not practice when it snowed. After three semesters at Swarthmore, she returned to California in January 1970, with the aim of becoming a professional tennis player.[3]: 32–38
Ride entered the University of California, Los Angeles, where she enrolled in courses inShakespeareandquantum mechanics, earning A's in both subjects. She was the only woman majoring in physics. She was romantically involved with theteaching assistant, John Tompkins, but the relationship ended in September when he went to Moscow to conduct research at theInstitute for High Energy Physics. Her foray into professional tennis was unsuccessful; after playing three matches in a single August morning her whole body ached the following day. She realized that far more effort would be necessary in order to reach the required level of fitness: she needed to practice for eight hours a day. She concluded that she did not have what it took to be a professional tennis player.[3]: 40–42
Ride applied for a transfer toStanford Universityas ajunior. The tennis coach was eager to have her on the team, and by coincidence, Fred Hargadon was now the dean of admissions there. He was once again instrumental in approving her admission. She graduated in 1973 with a Bachelor of Science degree in physics and a Bachelor of Arts degree in English literature.[3]: 44–45She then earned a Master of Science degree in physics in 1975 and a Doctor of Philosophy in 1978.[2]Astrophysics andfree-electron laserswere her areas of study.[8]She wrote her doctoral dissertation on "the interaction ofX-rayswith theinterstellar medium",[9]under the supervision ofArthur B. C. Walker Jr.[10]
At Stanford, Ride renewed her acquaintance with Molly Tyson, who was a year younger than her. The two had met on the tennis circuit as junior tennis players. Although Ride was rated number one at Stanford and Tyson was number six, the two playeddoublestogether. Ride later quit the Stanford tennis team in protest against the university's refusal to join thePac-8 Conferencein women's tennis.[3]: 45–49To earn money Ride and her then-girlfriend Tyson gave tennis lessons, and in 1971 and 1972 they were counselors atDennis Van der Meer's TennisAmericasummer campatLake Tahoe, Nevada. In August 1972, Ride played in a doubles match with Van der Meer againstBillie Jean King, theworld number 1 ranked female tennis player, and Dick Peters, the camp director;Martin Luther King IIIandDexter Kingserved asball boys. Billie Jean King became a mentor and a friend. Ride watched her win theBattle of the Sexesmatch againstBobby Riggsin 1973. Tyson ended their relationship in 1975, and Ride moved in with Bill Colson, a fellow graduate physics student who was recently divorced.[3]: 54–60

NASA astronaut

Selection and training
In January 1977, Ride spotted an article on the front page ofThe Stanford Dailythat told how theNational Aeronautics and Space Administration(NASA) was recruiting a new group ofastronautsfor theSpace Shuttleprogram and wanted to recruit women. No women had previously been NASA astronauts, although theSoviet Union'scosmonautValentina Tereshkovahad flown in space in 1963. Ride mailed a request for, and received the application forms. When asked for three persons with knowledge of her qualifications, she gave the names of three of her peers from college with whom she had been in relationships: Colson, Tompkins and Tyson.[11][3]: 78–82
Ride's was one of 8,079 applications NASA received by the June 30, 1977, deadline. She then became one of 208 finalists.[12]She was the only woman among the twenty applicants in the sixth group, all applicants formission specialistpositions, who reported to  NASA'sJohnson Space Center(JSC) inHouston, Texas, on October 3, for a week of  interviews and medical examinations.[13]Her physical fitness impressed the doctors. They placed her in aPersonal Rescue Enclosure, a ball 36 inches (91 cm) in diameter, to see if she suffered fromclaustrophobia. She was asked to write a one-page essay on why she wanted to become an astronaut. Finally, she was interviewed by the selection committee.[3]: 85–89On January 16, 1978, she received a phone call fromGeorge Abbey, NASA's director of flight operations, who informed her that she had been selected as part ofNASA Astronaut Group 8. She was one of 35 astronaut candidates in the group, of whom six were women.[12]
Group 8's name for itself was "TFNG". The abbreviation was deliberately ambiguous; for public purposes, it stood for "Thirty-Five New Guys", but within the group itself, it was known to stand for the military phrase, "the fucking new guy", used to denote newcomers to amilitary unit.[14]: 63Officially, they wereastronaut candidates; they would not become fully-fledged astronauts until they had completed their training. Ride was graded acivil serviceGS-12, with a salary of US$21,883 (equivalent to $105,496 in 2024). She bought ahousing unitin theNassau Bay, Texas, area, and moved in with Colson, who secured a research grant atRice Universityso they could move to Houston together. He became the only unmarried astronaut candidate's partner.[3]: 95–101Ride and Colson split up in January 1979, and she briefly dated fellow astronaut candidateRobert "Hoot" Gibson.[3]: 118–120
Astronaut candidate training included learning to fly NASA'sT-38 Talonjet aircraft. Officially, mission specialists did not have to qualify as pilots, only ride in the back seat and handle an emergency if the pilot became incapacitated. They were never to control the aircraft below 5,000 feet (1,500 m), but many of the astronaut pilots and pilot candidates, eager to share their love of flying, ignored the rules, and let the more proficient mission specialist candidates fly the jets lower.John Fabianeven had her fly "under the hood", with the windows blacked out and using instruments only. Ride enjoyed flying so much she took private flying lessons to earn aprivate pilot's license. She bought a part interest in aGrumman Tigeraircraft, which she would fly on weekends.[3]: 95–101On August 31, 1979, NASA announced that the 35 astronaut candidates had completed their training and evaluation, and were now officially astronauts, qualified for selection on space flight crews.[15]
In 1981, Ride began datingSteven Hawley, another one of the TFNGs. They moved in together, and considered themselves engaged. Unlike Colson, he was not aware of her earlier relationship with Tyson.[3]: 121They were married on July 26, 1982, in the backyard of Hawley's parents' house inSalina, Kansas. Ride flew up from Houston for the occasion in her Grumman Tiger, and wore white jeans. The ceremony was jointly conducted by Hawley's father Bernard, the pastor at the local Presbyterian church, and Ride's sister Bear. It was deliberately kept low-key, with only parents and siblings in attendance. They became the third NASA astronaut couple, afterRhea Seddonand Hoot Gibson, who had married a few months before, andAnna Fisherand her husbandBill Fisher, who became an astronaut couple when the latter was selected withNASA Astronaut Group 9in 1980. Ride did nottake her husband's name.[3]: 138–142

STS-7
Ride served as a ground-basedcapsule communicator(CapCom) for thesecondandthirdSpace Shuttle flights, and helped develop the Shuttle Remote Manipulator System (RMS), also known as the  "Canadarm" or robot arm.[16][17]She was the first woman to serve as a CapCom.[18]By early 1982, George Abbey and theChief of the Astronaut Office,John Young, wanted to begin scheduling missions with the TFNGs, starting with theseventh Space Shuttle mission. To command it, they choseRobert Crippen, who had flown with Young on thefirst Space Shuttle mission. They wanted a woman to fly on the mission, and since the mission involved the use of the RMS, the choice narrowed to Ride,Judy Resnikand Anna Fisher, who had specialized on it. Factors in Ride's favor included her agreeable personality and ability to work with others, her performance as CapCom, and her skill with the robot arm. However, JSC directorChris Kraftpreferred Fisher, and Abbey had to defend their decision. NASA Headquarters ultimately approved Ride's selection,[3]: 126–130[19]: 290–293which was officially announced in April 1982.[20]
As the first American woman to fly in space, Ride was subjected to media attention. There were over five hundred requests for private interviews, all of which were declined. Instead, NASA hosted the usual pre-launch press conference on May 24, 1983.[3]: 131, 147Ride was asked questions such as, "Will the flight affect your reproductive organs?" and "Do you weep when things go wrong on the job?" She insisted that she saw herself in only one way—as an astronaut.[16]NASA was still adjusting to female astronauts, and engineers had asked Ride to assist them in developing a "space makeup kit", assuming it would be something a woman would want on board. They also infamously suggested providing Ride with a supply of 100tamponsfor the six-day mission.[21][22]: 176–177
When theSpace ShuttleChallengerlifted off from theKennedy Space Center(KSC) on June 18, 1983, Ride became the first American woman to fly in space, and the third woman overall.[5]She also became the youngest American astronaut in space, although there had been younger Soviet cosmonauts.[23]Many of the people attending the launch wore T-shirts bearing the words "Ride, Sally Ride", lyrics fromWilson Pickett's song "Mustang Sally".[5]The purpose of the mission was to deploy twocommunications satellites:Anik C2forTelesatof Canada andPalapa B1for Indonesia. Both were deployed during the first two days of the mission.[24]
The mission also carried the firstShuttle pallet satellite(SPAS-1), which carried ten experiments to study formation of metalalloysinmicrogravity. Part of Ride's job was to operate the robot arm to deploy and later retrieve SPAS-1, which was brought back to Earth. The orbiter's smallReaction control systemrockets were fired while SPAS-1 was held by the remote manipulator system to test the movement on an extended arm.[25]STS-7 was also the first occasion on which the Space Shuttle in orbit was photographed, using the camera on SPAS-1. Ride manipulated the robot arm into the shape of a "7", as it appeared on the mission patch.[26]The mission also studiedSpace adaptation syndrome, a bout ofnauseafrequently experienced by astronauts during the early phase of a space flight.[25][2]Ride was not affected and did not require medication for the syndrome.[3]: 180Bad weather forcedChallengerto land atEdwards Air Force Basein California instead of theShuttle Landing Facilityat the KSC.[3]: 165The mission lasted 6 days, 2 hours, 23 minutes and 59 seconds.[24]
Now a celebrity, Ride, along with her STS-7 crewmates, spent the next few months after her flight on tour. She met with theGovernor of California,George Deukmejian, and theMayor of New York,Ed Koch. She testified before the Congressional Space Caucus on the efficacy of the robot arm, and addressed theNational Press Club, but declined to appear withBob Hope, whom she regarded as sexist. The crew presented PresidentRonald Reaganwithjelly beansthat had been flown on the flight.[3]: 171–177In September 1983, on her own initiative, she met withSvetlana Savitskaya, the second woman to fly in space, inBudapest. The two formed an instant camaraderie, and were able to converse for six hours thanks to Savitskaya's command of English. Savitskaya gave Ride Russian dolls, books and a scarf, and Ride gave Savitskaya an STS-7 charm that had flown on the mission and a TFNG shirt. They signed autographs for each other on Russianfirst day covers.[3]: 179–183

STS-41-G
While she was still engaged on the publicity tour, Abbey assigned Ride to the crew ofSTS-41-G. This was on Crippen's request; he had been assigned to another mission,STS-41-C, that would fly beforehand as part of a test to see how quickly crews could be turned around, and wanted Ride as his flight engineer again so that she could sit in for him during crew training for STS-41-G in the meantime. During mission simulations, she sat in the commander's left hand seat. Ride became the first American woman to fly twice, and her TFNG crewmateKathryn Sullivanbecame the first American woman to perform anextravehicular activity(EVA); Savitskaya had been the first woman to do both onSoyuz T-12in July 1984. It was the first time that two women were in space together.[3]: 188–191[27]
The mission lifted off from the KSC inChallengeron  October 5, 1984. The rookie astronauts on the flight were cautious about moving about too soon, lest they suffer from space adaptation syndrome, but Ride was now a veteran astronaut, one who knew that she would not be affected. Once in orbit she immediately and gracefully began moving about. The crew deployed the Earth Radiation Budget Satellite, conducted scientific observations of the Earth with the OSTA-3 pallet (including the SIR-B radar, FILE, and MAPS experiments) and large format camera (LFC), conducted numerous in-cabin experiments, and activated eightGetaway Specialcanisters containing experiments devised by outside groups.[27]
When the SIR-B antenna failed to unfold correctly, Ride used the robot arm to shake it loose, manipulating the robot arm much faster than she had been trained to. She also repaired a broken antenna on the middeck. During the second day of the mission, the SIR-B antenna had to be stowed soChallenger's orbit could be altered, but its latches failed to clamp and close the antenna, so Ride used the RMS to nudge the antenna panel closed. Sullivan performed an EVA with fellow TFNG mission specialistDavid Leestma, in which they showed that asatellitecould be refueled in orbit. On this missionChallengercompleted 132 orbits of the Earth in 197.5 hours, landing back at the KSC on October 13, 1984.[27][28][3]: 188–191During the mission, Ride carried a white silk scarf that had been worn byAmelia Earhart.[3]: 198On her two flights  Ride had spent over 343 hours in space.[29]

Planned third mission
Ride was soon back in the rotation, training for her third flight, STS-61-I. This mission was scheduled to be flown no later than July 15, 1986, and was to deploy theIntelsat VI-1 andINSAT1-C communications satellites and carry the Materials Science Lab-4.[30]The crew was subsequently switched toSTS-61-M, aTracking and Data Relay Satellite System(TRDS) deployment mission scheduled to be flown in July 1986.[31][32]She also served on two more missions as CapCom. On January 7, 1986, Ride provided a glowing reference for her friend, and eventual biographer,Lynn Sherrfor NASA'sJournalist in Space Project. Sherr became one of the finalists.[3]: 200–201During 1985, Ride began an affair withTam O'Shaughnessy. The two knew each other from the junior tennis circuit, and from when Ride was at Stanford.  O'Shaughnessy was now living in Atlanta, and had recently broken up with her female partner. Ride visited when she went to Atlanta on speaking engagements.[3]: 192–195Hawley was  aware that his marriage was in trouble, but not that O'Shaughnessy was more than a friend. Ride still performed her astronaut spouse duties for Hawley when he flew in space for the second time onSTS-61-Cin January 1986:[3]: 199astronauts and their spouses were quarantined for a few days before launch, and they stayed at theastronaut beach houseat the KSC. Spouses were expected to attend events before and after launches, including the post-mission publicity tour.[33]: 157–166This could be agonizing for a couple whose marriage was breaking up.[3]: 199

Rogers Commission
STS-61-M was cancelled after theSpace ShuttleChallengerdisasterlater that month.[31]Ride was appointed to theRogers Commission, thepresidential commissioninvestigating the disaster, and headed its subcommittee on operations. She was the only Space Shuttle astronaut and the only current NASA employee on the commission. After her death in 2012,Major GeneralDonald J. Kutynarevealed that she had discreetly provided him with key information thatO-ringsbecome stiff at low temperatures; this was eventually identified as the cause of theChallengerexplosion. To protect her as source, this information was fed to physicistRichard Feynman, who was credited for discovering and making public the O-ring problem. Ride was very disturbed by revelations of NASA dysfunctional management decision-making and risk-assessment processes such as those which did not detect the O-ring problem.[3]: 204–213[34][35]According toRoger Boisjoly, who was one of the engineers who warned of the technical problems that led to theChallengerdisaster, leading to the entire workforce of O-ring supplierMorton-Thiokolshunning him, Ride was the only public figure to show support for him when he went public with his pre-disaster warnings. Ride hugged him publicly to show her support for his efforts.[36]The Rogers Commission submitted its report on June 6, 1986.[35]
Following theChallengerinvestigation, Ride was assigned to NASA headquarters in Washington, D.C., where she led NASA's firststrategic planningeffort. She authored a report titled "NASA Leadership and America's Future in Space". NASA management was unhappy with its prioritization of Earth exploration over a mission to Mars. She founded NASA's Office of Exploration, which she headed for two months. On weekends she flew to Atlanta to be with O'Shaughnessy. In October 1986, she published a children's book,To Space and Back, which she co-wrote with Sue Okie, her high school and Swarthmore friend.[2][3]: 221–228

After NASA
In May 1987, Ride announced that she was leaving NASA to take up a two-year fellowship at the Stanford UniversityCenter for International Security and Arms Control(CISAC), commencing on August 15, 1987.[37]She divorced Hawley in June.[38]At Stanford, her colleagues includedCondoleezza Rice, a specialist on the Soviet Union. Ride researched means by whichnuclear warheadscould be counted and verified from space, but the impending end of theCold Warmade this much less pressing. As the end of her fellowship approached, Ride hoped to secure a permanent position at Stanford.Sidney Drell, who had recruited her, attempted to get a department to appoint her as a professor, but none would. Drell resigned from CISAC in protest.[3]: 231–234
On July 1, 1989, Ride became a professor of physics at theUniversity of California, San Diego(UCSD), and director of the California Space Institute (Cal Space), part of the university'sScripps Institution of Oceanography. She was paid a professor's salary of $64,000 (equivalent to $162,000 in 2024) plus a $6,000stipendas director of Cal Space, which employed 28 full- and part-time staff and had a budget of $3.3 million (equivalent to $8 million in 2024).[39]Her research primarily involved the study ofnonlinear opticsandThomson scattering.[40]She remained director of Cal Space until 1996. She retired from UCSD in 2007 and became aprofessor emeritus.[41]
From the mid-1990s until her death, Ride led two public-outreach programs for NASA—theISS EarthKAMandGRAIL MoonKAMprojects, in cooperation with NASA'sJet Propulsion Laboratoryand UCSD. The programs allowed middle school students to request images of the Earth and the Moon.[42][43]Ride bought a house inLa Jolla, California, and O'Shaughnessy moved in after taking up a teaching position atSan Diego Mesa College.[3]: 237She turned down offers from PresidentBill Clintonto becomeNASA Administrator, not wanting to leave California, but agreed to serve on thePresident's Committee of Advisors on Science and Technology(PCAST). This involved flying to Washington, D.C., every few months for studies and presentations. Due to the experience at CISAC, Clinton appointed her to a PCAST panel chaired byJohn Holdrento assess the risk offissilematerials being acquired in the former Soviet Union by terrorists in the chaos following its breakup.[3]: 249–250
Everywhere I go I meet girls and boys who want to be astronauts and explore space, or they love the ocean and want to be oceanographers, or they love animals and want to be zoologists, or they love designing things and want to be engineers. I want to see those same stars in their eyes in 10 years and know they are on their way.
From September 1999 to July 2000, Ride was the president of the space news website,Space.com, a company that aggregated news about science and space on its website.[3]: 257–260She then became the president and CEO ofSally Ride Science, a company she co-founded with O'Shaughnessy, who served as the chief executive officer and chair of the board.[5][45]Sally Ride Science created entertaining science programs and publications for upper elementary and middle school students, with a particular focus on girls.[46][47]It moved to the University of California, San Diego, in 2015.[48][49]Ride and O'Shaughnessy co-wrote six books on space aimed at children, with the goal of encouraging children to study science.[50][51][52]
In 2003, Ride served on theColumbiaAccident Investigation Board, and was the only person to serve on both the panel that investigated theChallengerdisaster and the one that investigated theColumbiadisaster.[3]: 279–285[53]She endorsedBarack Obamafor president in 2008,[54][55]and was contacted byLori Garver, the head of Barack Obama's transition team for NASA in 2008, but once again made it clear that she was not interested in the post of NASA administrator. She served on the board of theNational Math and Science Initiativein 2007 and the Educate to Innovate initiative in 2009, and was a member of theReview of United States Human Space Flight Plans Committee, which conducted an independent review of American space policy requested by theOffice of Science and Technology Policy(OSTP) on May 7, 2009.[3]: 285–287[56]

Death
When Ride delivered a speech at theNational Science Teachers Association Conferencein San Francisco on March 10, 2011, O'Shaughnessy noted that she looked ill, and had her book a doctor's appointment; amedical ultrasoundrevealed a tumor the size of a golf ball in her abdomen, which was found to bepancreatic cancer. She underwentchemotherapyandradiation therapy. Ride had ensured that O'Shaughnessy would inherit her estate when she drew up her will in 1992. They registered theirdomestic partnershipon August 15, 2011. On October 27, surgeons removed part of Ride's pancreas,bile duct,stomachandintestine, and hergallbladder.[3]: 301–308Ride died on July 23, 2012, at the age of 61, at her home in La Jolla.[57][58][59][60]
Followingcremation, her ashes were interred next to those of her father atWoodlawn Memorial Cemetery, Santa Monica.[61]Her papers are in theNational Air and Space MuseumArchives of theSmithsonian Institution.[31]Ride's obituary publicly revealed for the first time that O'Shaughnessy had been her partner for 27 years,[62][63]making her the first known LGBT astronaut.[64][65][66]The relationship was confirmed by Ride's sister Bear, who said Ride chose to keep her personal life, including her sickness and treatments, private.[67]

Awards and honors
Ride received numerous awards throughout her lifetime and after. She received theNational Space Society's von Braun Award, the Lindbergh Eagle by the Charles A. Lindbergh Fund, andthe NCAA's Theodore Roosevelt Award. She was inducted into theNational Women's Hall of Fameand theAstronaut Hall of Fameand was awarded theNASA Space Flight Medaltwice. Elementary schools in the United States were named after her, including Sally Ride Elementary School inThe Woodlands, Texas, and Sally Ride Elementary School inGermantown, Maryland.[2][68]In 1984, she received the Samuel S. Beard Award for Greatest Public Service by an Individual 35 Years or Under, an award given out annually byJefferson Awards.[69]California governorArnold Schwarzeneggerand first ladyMaria Shriverinducted Ride into theCalifornia Hall of Fameat theCalifornia Museum for History, Women, and the Artson December 6, 2006.[70]The following year she was inducted into theNational Aviation Hall of FameinDayton, Ohio.[71]
