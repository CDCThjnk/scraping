During the five-day mission, the crew aboard theSpace ShuttleDiscoverysuccessfully deployed theUpper Atmosphere Research Satellite(UARS), designed to provide scientists with their first complete data set on the upper atmosphere's chemistry, winds and energy inputs. The crew also conducted numerous secondary experiments ranging from growing protein crystals, to studying how fluids and structures react in weightlessness. After 81 orbits of the Earth,Discoverylanded atEdwards Air Force Base, California.[2]
More recently, Reightler served as pilot onSTS-60, the first joint U.S./Russian Space Shuttle Mission. Launching from theKennedy Space Centeron February 3, 1994, STS-60 was the first flight of theWake Shield Facility(WSF-1) and the second flight of the SpaceHab (Spacehab-2). During the eight-day flight, the crew ofDiscovery, including RussiancosmonautSergei Krikalev, conducted a wide variety of biological, materials science, earth observation, and life science experiments. Following 130 orbits of the Earth, STS-60 landed at Kennedy Space Center on February 11, 1994.[3]
With the completion of his second mission, Reightler has logged over 327 hours in space.
His technical assignments to date have included: Chief of the Astronaut Office Space Station Branch; Chief of the Astronaut Office Mission Support Branch; Lead Spacecraft Communicator (CAPCOM); Lead Astronaut for flight software development and computer systems; Flight Crew Operations Directorate representative to the Program Requirements Control Board; weather coordinator for Space Shuttle launches and landings; Astronaut Office representative in the areas of ascent, entry, and aborts.
