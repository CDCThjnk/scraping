Kelly flew combat missions during theGulf Waras anaval aviatorbefore being selected as aNASASpace Shuttlepilot in 1996. He flew his first space mission in 2001 as pilot ofSTS-108, then pilotedSTS-121in 2006, and commandedSTS-124in 2008 andSTS-134(the final mission ofSpace ShuttleEndeavour) in 2011. In January 2011, Kelly's wife, then-Arizona RepresentativeGabby Giffords, was shot and nearly killed inan assassination attemptin Arizona. Kelly retired from the Navy and NASA that October. In 2013, Kelly and Giffords founded a nonprofit political action committee,Americans for Responsible Solutions(later merged intoGiffords), which campaigned forgun controlmeasures likeuniversal background checks.
On February 12, 2019, Kelly announced his candidacy for Arizona'sClass 3U.S. Senate seat in the2020 special election.[a]He won the Democratic primary on August 4, 2020, and defeated incumbent RepublicanMartha McSallyin the general election on November 3, becoming the first Democrat to win this seat since1962.

IndependentKyrsten Sinema's departure from the Senate in 2025 made Kelly Arizona's senior senator.[3]He was reportedly one of the three leading contenders for theDemocratic vice presidential nominationin the2024 U.S. presidential election, along with Pennsylvania governorJosh Shapiroand Minnesota governorTim Walz.[4]Presidential nomineeKamala Harrisultimately chose Walz.[5]

Early life and education
Mark Kelly[6]and his identical twin brother,Scott Kelly, are sons of Richard and Patricia (née McAvoy) Kelly, two retired police officers.[7][8]Kelly is of Irish descent.[9]He was born on February 21, 1964, inOrange, New Jersey, and raised inWest Orange, New Jersey. Kelly graduated fromMountain High Schoolin 1982. In 1986, he took highest honors in amarine engineeringandnautical scienceBScfrom theUnited States Merchant Marine Academy. In 1994, he received aMScinaeronautical engineeringfrom the U.S.Naval Postgraduate School.[10]

Naval career (1987–2011)
In December 1987, Kelly became anaval aviatorand received initial training on theA-6E Intruderattack aircraft. He was then assigned to Attack Squadron 115 (VA-115) atNAF Atsugiin Kanagawa, Japan.  He was deployed twice with VA-115 to thePersian Gulfaboard the aircraft carrierUSSMidway, which was homeported atNaval Station YokosukainYokosuka, Japan. DuringOperation Desert Storm, Kelly flew 39combat missions. After the Gulf War, Kelly received his master's degree and then attendedU.S. Naval Test Pilot Schoolfrom 1993 to 1994. As a naval aviator and test pilot, he has logged over 5,000 hours in more than 50 different aircraft and trapped over 375 carrier landings.[10]
During his Navy career, Kelly received twoDefense Superior Service Medals; oneLegion of Merit; twoDistinguished Flying Crosses; fourAir Medals(two individual/two strike flight) with Combat "V"; twoNavy Commendation Medals, (one with combat "V"); oneNavy Achievement Medal; twoSouthwest Asia Service Medals; oneNavy Expeditionary Medal; twoSea Service Deployment Ribbons; aNASA Distinguished Service Medal; and anOverseas Service Ribbon.[10][11]
On June 21, 2011, Kelly announced his retirement from both the Navy andNASA, effective October 1, citingGabby Giffords's needs during her recovery from theattempt on her lifethat January.[2]

NASA career (1996–2011)
NASA selected both Kelly and hisidentical twin,Scott Kelly, to be Space Shuttle pilots in 1996. They joined theNASA Astronaut Corpsin August of that year.[10]They are the only siblings to have both traveled into orbit.[12][13]

Spaceflight experience
Kelly's first trip into space was as pilot of STS-108. After several delays,Endeavourlifted off on December 5, 2001, on the final Shuttle mission of 2001.[14]
STS-108Endeavourvisited the ISS, delivering over three tons of equipment, supplies, and a fresh crew to the orbiting outpost.[10]The hatches were opened betweenEndeavourand the ISSDestinyLaboratory on December 7, enabling the 10 crew members to greet one another. TheExpedition 3crew officially ended their 117-day residency on board the ISS on December 8 as their customSoyuzseat-liners were transferred toEndeavourfor the return trip home. The transfer of theExpedition 4seat-liners to theSoyuzreturn vehicle attached to the station marked the official exchange of crews.[14]
Kelly and Mission SpecialistLinda Godwinused the shuttle's robotic arm to lift the Raffaello Multi-Purpose Logistics Module from the shuttle payload bay and attach it to a berth on the station's Unity node. The crews began unloading supplies the same day. Mission managers extendedEndeavour'sflight duration to 12 days to allow the crew to assist with additional maintenance tasks on the station, including work on a treadmill and replacing a failed compressor in one of the air conditioners in the Zvezda Service Module. A change of command ceremony took place on December 13 as Expedition 3 ended and Expedition 4 began. STS-108 returned to Earth with the previous ISS crew of three men.[14]
Kelly traveled over 4.8 million miles and orbited the Earth 186 times over 11 days and 19+ hours.[14]
In July 2006, Kelly piloted STS-121Discovery, the second "Return to Flight" mission afterthe lossofColumbiain February 2003. Because of weather delays, STS-121 became the first shuttle mission to launch on theFourth of July.[16]In 2006, Kelly discussed the risks aboard the Space Shuttle:
The Space Shuttle's a very complex machine. It's got a lot of moving parts that move and operate at pretty much the limit of what we've been able to engineer. Spaceflight is risky. I think with regards to the tank, we've reduced some of the risk there. We've changed the design a little bit and we've made some pretty big strides in trying to get foam not to shed from the tank anymore. So there is some risk reduction there and I guess overall the risk is probably a little less. But this is a risky business, but it's got a big reward. Everybody on board Discovery and the space station here thinks it's worthwhile.[17]
The mission's main purposes were to test new safety and repair techniques introduced after theColumbiadisaster and to deliver supplies, equipment, andEuropean Space AgencyastronautThomas Reiterfrom Germany to the ISS. Reiter's transfer returned the ISS to a three-member staffing level.[18]
During the STS-121 mission to the ISS, the crew ofDiscoverycontinued to test new equipment and procedures for the inspection and repair of the thermal protection system that is designed to increase the shuttles' safety. It also delivered more supplies and cargo for future ISS expansion.
After theColumbiaaccident, NASA decided that two test flights would be required and that activities originally assigned toSTS-114would be divided into two missions because of the addition of post-Columbiasafety tests.[18]
Gabby Giffords, Kelly's girlfriend at the time, picked one of the mission's wake-up songs,U2's "Beautiful Day".[19]During theU2 360° Tour, Kelly often appeared on screen from the International Space Station during the song's introduction, greeting the city the band was playing in and asking the crowd to "tell my wife I love her very much, she knows"[20]—a reference toDavid Bowie's "Space Oddity"; the tour's staging was often called the "space station".[21]
Kelly traveled over 5.28 million miles and orbited the Earth 202 times over 12 days and 18+ hours.[10]
STS-124Discoverywas Kelly's first mission as commander. A month before liftoff, he discussed what being a shuttle commander entailed and how it was different from his previous missions:
My first two flights I was the pilot. Being the commander is different in that you're responsible for the overall mission. ... You have to worry about the whole thing, the training drill your other crew members are getting, mission success, and mission safety. So it is a more comprehensive job and requires more time. I'm really a little bit surprised at how much more there is to it. But I think it's more rewarding as well.[22]
The mission was the second of three shuttle missions to carry components ofJapan's Kibo laboratoryto the ISS.Kibois Japanese for "hope". The laboratory is Japan's primary contribution to the ISS.[23]
Just before liftoff, Kelly said, "While we've all prepared for this event today, the discoveries from Kibo will definitely offer hope for tomorrow. Now stand by for the greatest show on Earth."[24]
During the launch,Launch Pad 39Asustained substantial damage, more than had been seen on any previous launch. After liftoff, inspectors discovered that bricks and mortar from the launch pad's base had been thrown as far as the perimeter fence, a distance of 1,500 feet (457 m).[25]
Kelly and his crew delivered the pressurized module for Kibo to the ISS. The module is the Kibo laboratory's largest component and the station's largest habitable module.[23]Discoveryalso delivered Kibo's Remote Manipulator System.[23]It also delivered a replacement part for thestation's toilet. The ISS's toilet had been malfunctioning for a week, creating a potentially serious problem for the crew.[26]When Kelly first entered the station, he joked, "You looking for a plumber?"[26]
This mission was the first time a spouse of a member of Congress traveled to space.[27]Kelly traveled over 5.7 million miles, and orbited the Earth 218 times over 13 days and 18 hours.[10]As of 2009, Kelly had logged over 54 days in space overall.[10]
STS-134 launched on May 16, 2011.
On April 29, 2011, the first launch attempt of STS-134 was scrubbed. Giffords traveled to Florida on her first trip since moving fromTucsontoHoustonin January after an attempted assassination. Her appearance atKennedy Space Centergave the launch a high profile, "one of the most anticipated in years," according toThe New York Times. PresidentBarack Obamavisited the Kennedy Space Center on April 29 on a trip with the original intention of watching theEndeavourlaunch.[29]
Kelly was the commander of the mission, which wasEndeavour's last.[30]He and his crew delivered theAlpha Magnetic Spectrometerto the ISS.[31]
Most of the mission's delays were caused byexternal tankissues onSTS-133Discovery.[32]When Scott Kelly went to the ISS on October 7, 2010, STS-134 was scheduled to go to the station during his mission. The potential rendezvous in space of the Kelly brothers would have been a first meeting of blood relatives in space.[33]The delay of STS-134's launch ended that possibility.
After his wife's shooting, Kelly's status was unclear, but NASA announced on February 4, 2011, that he would remain commander of the mission. The remarkable progress his wife was making in her recovery helped Kelly decide to return to training.[34]Peggy Whitson, chief of the NASA Astronaut Office at the time, said, "we are confident in his ability to successfully lead this mission, and I know I speak for all of NASA in saying 'welcome back.'"[35]
At 4 pmPDTon May 22, 2011, theEuropean Space AgencyandItalian Space Agencyarranged for a call toEndeavourbyPope Benedict XVI. During his call—prompted by the discovery of a gash in the Shuttle's fuselage—Benedict extended his blessing to Giffords, who had undergone skull surgery earlier in the week. The event marked the first time a pope spoke to astronauts during a mission.[36][37]
On June 24, 2011, a recorded message by Kelly from the ISS wished his wife love using song lyrics fromDavid Bowie's "Space Oddity" and introducedU2's song "Beautiful Day" on the first night of theGlastonbury festivalin England. A similar message from Kelly aboard the ISS was played duringU2's 360° Tourconcert stop at various locations. It said: "I'm looking forward to coming home. Tell my wife I love her very much. She knows."[38]

Retirement
On June 21, 2011, Kelly announced that he would leave NASA's astronaut corps and the U.S. Navy effective October 1. He cited Giffords's needs during her recovery as a reason for his retirement.[2]He announced his retirement on hisFacebookpage, writing: "Words cannot convey my deep gratitude for the opportunities I have been given to serve our great nation. From the day I entered the United States Merchant Marine Academy in the summer of 1982 to the moment I landed the Space ShuttleEndeavourthree weeks ago, it has been my privilege to advance the ideals that define the United States of America."[39]

Post-NASA career (2011–2016)

In 2015, Kelly and Martha Freeman co-wroteAstrotwins: Project Blastoff,a fictional story about twins Scott and Mark who build a space capsule in their grandfather's backyard and try to send the first kid into orbit. Kelly dedicated this book to Scott Kelly.[45]The sequel,Astrotwins—Project Rescue, was published in 2016.[46]

Aerospace work
Kelly was a co-founder and strategic advisor of Tucson-basedhigh-altitude balloonnear-space exploration companyWorld View Enterprises.[47]He served as Director of Flight Crew Operations beginning in 2013, and was involved in the development of the new craft, as well as its procedures and operations.[48]Chinese companyTencentinvested millions into World View between 2013 and 2016.[49]Kelly left World View in 2019, before he started his Senate campaign; as of 2021 he held over $100,000 of World View stocks through a blind trust.[49]

Political activism
In January 2013, weeks after theSandy Hook Elementary School shooting, Kelly and Giffords started a nonprofit political action committee,Americans for Responsible Solutions(ARS). The organization's mission is to promote solutions to gun violence with elected officials and the general public. The couple say it supports theSecond Amendmentwhile promoting responsible gun ownership and "keeping guns out of the hands of dangerous people like criminals, terrorists, and the mentally ill".[54]The group claims that "current gun laws allow private sellers to sell guns without a background check, creating a loophole that provides criminals and the mentally ill easy access to guns".[54]On March 31, 2013, Kelly said, "any bill that does not include auniversal background checkis a mistake. It's the most common-sense thing we can do to prevent criminals and the mentally ill from having access to weapons."[55]In 2016, ARS merged with theLaw Center to Prevent Gun Violenceto becomeGiffords,[56]which besides background checks advocates forred flag laws.[57][58][59][60]

Kelly split his vote by voting yes on another resolution blockingF-35sales to the UAE. Both resolutions failed.[69]
In the wake of theJanuary 6 U.S. Capitol attack, Kelly said that Vice PresidentMike Penceand Trump's cabinet "have the responsibility to discuss invoking the 25th amendment",Section 4of which allows the vice president and cabinet to declare the president unable to serve and transfer presidential power to the vice president. Kelly voted to convict inTrump's second impeachment trial, along with 56 other senators.[70]
In January 2023, three bills regarding Indian tribes, introduced by Kelly and fellow Arizona SenatorKyrsten Sinema, were signed into law by PresidentJoe Biden.[71]One bill regarding the White Mountain Apache Tribe Water Rights Quantification Act allocated more federal money and time to build water infrastructure for theWhite Mountain Apache Tribe.[71]A second bill, the Colorado River Indian Tribes Water Resiliency Act, permitted theColorado River Indian Tribes(theMohave,Chemehuevi,Hopi, andNavajo) to begin leasing out parts of theColorado Riverthey were allocated, while a third bill, the Hualapai Tribe Water Rights Settlement Act, allocated part of the Colorado River to theHualapaitribe, so that water infrastructure can deliver water to the tribe.[71]

Personal life
Kelly married Amelia Victoria Babis on January 7, 1989. They divorced in 2004. They have two daughters, Claudia and Claire Kelly.[112]
Kelly married U.S. Representative Gabby Giffords of Tucson on November 10, 2007, in a ceremony presided over by Rabbi Stephanie Aaron and attended by his STS-124 shuttle crew and formerSecretary of LaborRobert Reich. Reich toasted: "To a bride who moves at a velocity that exceeds that of anyone else in Washington, and a groom who moves at a velocity that exceeds 17,000 miles per hour."[19]The couple met on a 2003 trip toChinaas part of a trade mission sponsored by the National Committee on U.S.–China Relations.[113]
At the time of their marriage, Kelly lived inHouston,Texas,[114]and said that the longest stretch of time the two had spent together was a couple of weeks. He said that they did not plan to always live that way, but that it was what they were used to. He added, "It teaches you not to sweat the small stuff."[19]
Kelly appeared on an episode ofCelebrity Jeopardy!in 2015.[115]

Shooting in Tucson
Giffords was shot in an assassination attempt on January 8, 2011,[116]which killed six people and brought national attention to Kelly.[117][118]On February 4, Kelly described the previous month as the hardest time of his life[119]and expressed his gratitude for the enormous outpouring of support, good wishes and prayers for his wife. He said that he believed people's prayers for her helped.[120]
One of Giffords's aides informed Kelly of the shooting almost immediately after it happened. He flew from Houston to Tucson with members of his family. En route, the Kellys received an erroneous news report that Giffords had died. "The kids, Claudia and Claire, started crying. My mother, she almost screamed. I just walked into the bathroom, and, you know, broke down." Calling family in Tucson, Kelly found out that the report was false and that she was alive and in surgery. "It was a terrible mistake," Kelly said. "As bad as it was that she had died, it's equally exciting that she hadn't."[121]
From the time he arrived in Tucson, Kelly sat vigil at his wife's bedside as she struggled to survive and began to recover. As her condition began to improve, the Kelly-Giffords family researched options for rehabilitation facilities and chose one in Houston. On January 21, Giffords was transferred to theMemorial Hermann–Texas Medical Center,[122]where she spent five days before moving toTIRR Memorial Hermann, where she continued her recovery and rehabilitation.[123]
Giffords and Kelly had spoken dozens of times about how risky her job was. She was afraid that someone with a gun would come up to her at a public event. In an interview filmed just over a week after the shooting, Kelly said, "She hasTombstone, Arizona, in her district, the town that's too tough to die. Gabrielle Giffords is too tough to let this beat her."[121]
A memorial service for those killed in the assassination attempt was held on January 12, 2011, at the University of Arizona. President Obama flew to Tucson tospeak at the memorial. Kelly sat between First LadyMichelle Obamaand Secretary of Homeland SecurityJanet Napolitano, the former governor of Arizona. At the end of the service, Obama consoled and embraced him, after which Kelly returned to the hospital to be with his wife.[124]
Kelly spoke on February 3, 2011, at theNational Prayer BreakfastinWashington, D.C.His remarks closed the event, where Obama also spoke. Kelly said the attack on his wife brought him closer to God and gave him a newfound awareness regarding prayer. He said that before the attack, "I thought the world just spins and the clock just ticks and things happen for no particular reason", but that, in Tucson, as he found himself wandering in makeshift memorials and shrines filled with Bibles and angels, "You pray where you are. You pray when God is there in your heart."[125]Kelly offered the final prayer of the morning, lightly adapted by Rabbi Stephanie Aaron from a traditionalbedtime prayer. Rabbi Aaron, who married Kelly and Giffords, had said the same words over Giffords on the night of the shooting:
In the name of God, our God of Israel, may Michael, God's angel messenger of compassion, watch over your right side. May Gabriel, God's angel messenger of strength and courage, be on your left. And before you, guiding your path, Uriel, God's angel of light and behind you, supporting you, stands Raphael, God's angel of healing. And over your head, surrounding you, is the presence of the Divine.[125]
In 2011, Kelly said he believed there was a chance to change a political environment he believed was too vitriolic. He hoped that the tragedy would be an opportunity to improve the tone of the national dialogue and cool down the rhetoric.[121]In response to a question on February 4, 2011, about civility in politics, Kelly said, "I haven't spent a lot of time following that, but I think that with something that was so horrible and so negative, and the fact that six people lost their lives including a nine-year-old girl, a federal judge, Gabby's staff member Gabe—who was like a younger brother to her—it's really, really a sad situation. I am hopeful that something positive can come out of it. I think that will happen, so those are good things."[120]
