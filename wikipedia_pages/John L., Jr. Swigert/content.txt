John Leonard Swigert Jr.(August 30, 1931 – December 27, 1982) was an AmericanNASAastronaut,test pilot,mechanical engineer,aerospace engineer,United States Air Forcepilot, andpolitician. In April 1970, as command module pilot ofApollo 13, he became one of24 astronauts who flew to the Moon.[1][2]Due to the "slingshot" route around the Moon they chose to safely return to Earth, the Apollo 13 astronauts flew farther away from Earth than any other astronauts before or since, though they had to abort the Moon landing.
Before joining NASA in 1966, Swigert was a civiliantest pilotandfighter pilotin theAir National Guard. After leaving NASA, he ran forSenatebut lost in a primary election againstBill Armstrong. Later he ran forCongress, but was diagnosed with cancer while running. He won the election for Colorado's new6th districtin 1982, but died before being sworn in.

Early life
John Leonard Swigert Jr. was born on August 30, 1931, inDenver,Coloradoto parents Dr. John Leonard Swigert Sr. (1903–1973) and Virginia Anne Swigert (néeSeep; 1906–1993). Swigert's father was anophthalmologist.[1][2]At the age of 14, he became fascinated by aviation. While he would have been content just watching planes take off from nearby Combs Field, young Jack became determined to do more than be a spectator. He took on a newspaper route to earn money for flying lessons, and by age 16 he was alicensed private pilot.[3]He was a member of theBoy Scouts of Americaand attained the rank ofSecond Class Scout.[4][5]He attended Blessed Sacrament School,Regis Jesuit High SchoolandEast High School, from which he graduated in 1949.[6]
Swigert received aBachelor of Sciencedegree inmechanical engineeringfromUniversity of Coloradoin 1953, where he also playedfootballfor theBuffaloes.[1][2]He later earned aMaster of Sciencedegree inaerospace engineeringfromRensselaer Polytechnic Institute(Hartford campus) in 1965,[7]and aMaster of Business Administrationdegree fromUniversity of Hartfordin 1967.[8]
His recreational interests includedgolf,handball,bowling,skiing,swimming, andbasketball. His hobbies includedphotography.[6]

Flight experience
Following his graduation from Colorado in 1953, Swigert joined theUnited States Air Force(USAF). Upon graduation from the Pilot Training Program andGunnery SchoolatNellis Air Force Base,Nevada, he was assigned as afighter pilotinJapanandSouth Korea. In 1953, he survived his plane crashing into a radar unit on a Korean airstrip.[3][2]
After completing his tour of active duty in the USAF, he served as a jet fighter pilot with theMassachusetts(1957–1960) andConnecticut Air National Guard(1960–1965).[9]Swigert held a position as engineering test pilot forNorth American Aviationbefore joining NASA. He was previously an engineering test pilot forPratt & Whitney, from February 1957 to June 1964.[10]
He logged over 7,200 hours in flight, including more than 5,725 hours injet aircraft.[6]

NASA career
After unsuccessfully applying for NASA'ssecondandthirdastronaut selections,[11]Swigert was accepted into theNASA Astronaut Corpsas part ofNASA Astronaut Group 5in April 1966.[12]Swigert became a specialist on theApollo command module: he was one of the few astronauts who requested to be command module pilots.[11]
Swigert was a member ofApollo 7's astronaut support crew, the first support crew for an Apollo mission; he served asCapsule communicator(CAPCOM) during the ascent phase of the flight.[13]

Apollo 13
Swigert was one of three astronauts aboard theApollo 13Moon mission launched April 11, 1970. Originally part of the backup crew for the mission, he was assigned to the mission three days before launch, replacing astronautKen Mattingly. The prime crew had been exposed toGerman Measles(the rubella virus) fromCharles Dukeand, because Mattingly had no immunity to the disease, NASA did not want to risk him falling ill during critical phases of the flight.[14]
Apollo 13 was the third crewed lunar-landing attempt, but was aborted after the rupture of an oxygen tank in the spacecraft'sservice module. Swigert was the astronaut who first announced, "Houston, we've had a problem here".[15]The statement was then repeated by commander of the flightJim Lovell. Swigert, along with fellow astronauts Lovell andFred Haise, traveled around the Moon and returned safely to Earth on April 17 after about 5 days and 23 hours, and received thePresidential Medal of Freedomthe next day.[16]

Apollo–Soyuz Test Project
NASA Director of Flight Crew OperationsDeke Slayton, who selected the astronauts, recommended Swigert ascommand module pilotfor theApollo–Soyuz Test Project, the first joint mission with theSoviet Union. Slayton felt Swigert deserved another chance to fly after having been selected for Apollo 13 two days before launch, and performing well.[17]
During 1972, theApollo 15 postal covers incidentcaused NASA investigators to inquire into other astronauts.[3]A number of Apollo astronauts, including Swigert, had made agreements with West German stamp dealer Hermann Sieger, who originated the idea for theApollo 15covers, to autograph philatelic items in exchange for a payment of about $2,500. Swigert originally denied involvement when interviewed by NASA investigators.[18]According toChristopher C. Kraft, the investigators subpoenaed his bank records, finding more funds than expected, and records of a predated charitable donation.[19]Swigert's subsequent admission caused NASA Deputy AdministratorGeorge M. Lowto remove him from Apollo–Soyuz.[3]

Post-NASA career
Aware that his spaceflight career was most likely over,[3]Swigert took a leave of absence from NASA in April 1973 and went toWashington, D.C.to become executive director of theCommittee on Science and Astronautics,U.S. House of Representatives.[20]
Swigert eventually left NASA and the committee in August 1977 to enter politics.[21]He ran for theU.S. Senatefrom Colorado in 1978, but was soundly defeated in the Republican primary in September byCongressmanBill Armstrong, who was far better known.[22]In 1979, Swigert became vice president of B.D.M. Corporation inGolden.[13]He left in 1981 to join International Gold and Minerals Limited as vice president for financial and corporate affairs.[23]
In February 1982, Swigert left International Gold and Minerals Limited to run forU.S. Congressin the newly created6th districtas a Republican. When amalignant tumorin his right nasal passage was found, the astronaut-politician disclosed this to the voters. Doctors told him he would finish radiation treatments on June 15 and make a complete recovery.[24]However, in August, Swigert developed back pain and was diagnosed withbone marrow cancer.[25]On November 2, 1982, he won the seat with 64% of the popular vote.[26]

Death
On December 19, 1982, seven weeks after his election, he was airlifted from his home inLittletontoGeorgetown University Hospitalin Washington, D.C. He died ofrespiratory failureat itsLombardi Cancer Centeron December 27, seven days before the beginning of his congressional term, aged 51.[27][28][29]He was the last member-elect of the House to die before taking office untilLuke Letlow's death fromCOVID-19in December 2020.
Fifteen astronauts, including fellow Apollo 13 crewmatesJim LovellandFred Haise, were among the thousand mourners at hisfull military honorsfuneral in Denver, presided over byArchbishopJames Casey, which included amissing man flyoverbyA-7 Corsairsof theColorado Air National Guard.[30]He is buried alongside his parents inMount Olivet CemeteryinWheat Ridge.[31]

Awards, honors, and organizations
Swigert received theAmerican Institute of Aeronautics and Astronautics(AIAA)Octave Chanute Awardfor 1966 for his participation in demonstrating theRogallo wingas a feasible land landing system for returning space vehicles and astronauts.[32]
