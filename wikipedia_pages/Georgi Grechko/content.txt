Georgy Mikhaylovich Grechko(Russian:Георгий Михайлович Гречко; 25 May 1931 – 8 April 2017) was aSovietcosmonaut.  He flew to space on three missions, each bound for rendezvous with a differentSalyutspace station.[1]Soyuz 17was the first crewed vehicle to visitSalyut 4,Soyuz 26was the first crewed vehicle to visitSalyut 6, andSoyuz T-14visitedSalyut 7.  During the latter mission, Grechko helped to relieve the crew ofSoyuz T-13, who had repaired damage to the station.

Biography
Grechko graduated from theLeningrad Institute of Mechanicswith a doctorate in mathematics. He was a member ofCommunist Party of the Soviet Union. He went on to work atSergei Korolev's design bureau and from there was selected for cosmonaut training for the Soviet Moon programme. When that program was cancelled, he went on to work on theSalyutspace stations.
Grechko made the first spacewalk in anOrlan space suiton 20 December 1977 during theSalyut 6EO-1 mission.
He was twice awarded the medal ofHero of the Soviet Union.
He resigned from the space programme in 1992 to lecture on atmospheric physics at theRussian Academy of Sciences.  Grechko has written his memoirs as "Космонавт No. 34: От лучины до пришельцев," (Cosmonaut No. 34 From Splinter to Aliens) Olma Media Grupp, Moscow, 2013.
Aminor planet3148 Grechkodiscovered bySovietastronomerNikolai Stepanovich Chernykhin 1979 is named after him.[2]
Grechko had a brief cameo role in Richard Viktorov's 1981 filmPer Aspera Ad Astra, and as a result attained pop culture status in his home city ofLeningrad.[3]He also appeared in the 1979 filmUnder the Constellation Gemini.
Grechko, along withAlexei Leonov,Vitaly Sevastyanov, andRusty Schweickartestablished theAssociation of Space Explorersin 1984. Membership is open to all people who have flown inouter space.
Grechko died aged 85 as a result of several chronic illnesses. He was survived by wife Lyudmila and daughter Olga.[1]

Soyuz–Salyut missions
Georgy Grechko's first mission to space began during the winter of 1974, when he and fellow Soviet cosmonautAleksei Gubarevwere crewmen of the Soyuz 17-Salyut 4 mission.[4]The Soyuz 17 rocket launched on 26 December 1974 and successfully docked with the Salyut 4 Space Station on 12 January 1975. This successful docking marked only the second complete success in five Soyuz-Salyut undertakings. The cosmonauts spent the remainder of their mission aboard the three room, 20 ton station. During their time aboard the Salyut 4 Space Station, Grechko and Gubarev conducted a wide range of studies that included infrared temperature scans of earth's upper atmosphere, stellar observations and X-ray studies of the sun.[5]In order to maintain fitness in weightlessness, Grechko spent up to two hours a day exercising on a bicycle and treadmill, as well as experimenting with wearing negative pressure suits. Grechko and Gubarev spent a total of 30 days in orbit, which set the Soviet record at the time, before returning safely on 9 February 1975.
In December 1977, Georgy Grechko returned to space withYuri Romanenkoduring the Soyuz 26-Salyut 6 mission. The crew boarded the Soviet Salyut 6 Space Station, where they would stay long enough to eclipse the 84-day record set in 1974 by US Skylab astronautsGerald Carr,William Pogue, andEdward Gibson.[6]In January 1978, Grechko and Romanenko were joined by fellow cosmonautsVladimir DzhanibekovandOleg Makarov, who linked their Soyuz 27 craft with the Salyut 6 Space Station and spent five days aboard the station along with Grechko and Romanenko, before returning to earth in Soyuz 26 craft. This event marked the first double docking and first double crew occupancy of a space station. On March 4, Grechko and Romanenko were joined by a different Soviet crew, consisting of Aleksei Gubarev (Grechko's partner from his previous mission) and Czechoslavakian Vladimir Raemk, the first non-Russian cosmonaut.
The crew members of the Salyut 6 Space Station became the first men to carry out a systematic visual-instrumental observation of the earth.[7]Their extended stay is what allowed the crew to pull off such an observation, as it takes two to three weeks for human eyesight to adapt to conditions in orbit. After several weeks in orbit, the members of the Salyut 6 crew were able to examine the finer details of the landscape, which included the traces left on the water surface by typhoons, enormous solitary waves that were over 100 kilometers long, and some of the characteristic features of the ocean floor. On March 15, after spending a record-setting total of 96 days in orbit, Grechko and Romanenko finally left the Salyut 6 Space Station and returned to earth aboard the Soyuz 27 spacecraft.[8]After spending such an extended period of time in orbit, the crew began an expanded exercise routine a week prior to departure that was intended to minimize the effects of the return to normal gravity. Despite this training, both Grechko and Romanenko struggled to complete easy tasks shortly following their return, such as turning a radio dial or lifting a cup of tea. Fortunately, neither cosmonaut reported any serious readjustment issues.
