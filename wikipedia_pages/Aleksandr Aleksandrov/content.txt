Alexander Andreevich Alexandrov(Russian:Александръ Александровъ; bornNadezhda Andreyevna Durova; 17 September 1783 – 21 March 1866) was a Russian cavalry soldier and writer who participated in theNapoleonic Wars. Alexandrov wasassigned female at birth, butpresentedas a man for his entire adult life.[1]
At twenty-three, Alexandrov fled his home, and enlisted in anuhlan(light cavalry) regiment, dressing as a male soldier and taking on the nameAlexander Sokolov.[2]He served from 1806 to 1816, and received theCross of St. Georgefor bravery.[2]After his service, he published a memoir, originally titled, "Notes of Alexsandrov", one of the earliest autobiographies in theRussian language.[3]To his outrage, publishers re-titled it using his birth name "Notes of N.A. Durova", and eventuallyThe Cavalry Maiden.[4]
Historians have traditionally regarded him as a femalewartime cross-dresser, while several modern scholars describe him as atransgender man.[4][5][6]

Early life
Alexander Andreevich Alexandrov (named Nadezhda Andreyevna Durova), was born on September 17, 1783,[7]into the family of a Russian major.[7][8]Sources identify his birth place as either theVyatka Governorateof theRussian Empire,[9]an army camp inKyiv,[10][11]orKherson.[7]His mother came from a family of wealthy landowners fromPoltava, and married his father against the will of his own father. According to Alexandrov, his mother "passionately wanted to have a son" and was dismayed to apparently have a daughter instead;[12]he describes an incident in which she—furious at her infant for crying all night—threw him from the window of a moving carriage, nearly killing him.[12]After that his father placed him in the care of his soldiers. As a child, Alexandrov learned the standard marching commands, and an unloaded gun was his favorite toy.[13]
After his father retired from service, he continued playing with broken sabers and frightened his family by secretly taming a stallion that they considered unbreakable.[14]
In 1801, he married aSarapuljudge, Vasily Stefanovich Chernov, a man seven years his senior. He gave birth to Chernov's son on January 4, 1803.[15]On September 17, 1806,[7][16]Alexandrov dressed in aCossack uniform, abandoned home,[16]and enlisted in the PolishUhlanRegiment, presenting himself as a nobleman named Alexander Sokolov.[8][15]

Military service and later life
As "Alexander Sokolov", he fought in the major Russian engagements of the1806–1807 Prussian campaign. During two of those battles, he saved the lives of two fellow Russian soldiers. The first was an enlisted man who suffered a concussion falling off his horse in battle. Alexandrov provided first aid under heavy fire, and brought him to safety as the army retreated around them. The second was an officer, unhorsed but uninjured. Three Frenchdragoonswere closing on him. Alexandrov couched hislanceand scattered the enemy. Then, against regulations, he let the officer borrow his own horse to hasten his retreat, which left Alexandrov himself more vulnerable to attack.
During the campaign, he wrote to his family explaining his disappearance. They used their connections in a desperate attempt to locate him. Rumors of anAmazon warriorin the army reachedTsar Alexander I, who took a personal interest and summoned him the palace atSt. Petersburg, where he was awarded theCross of St. Georgeand promoted tolieutenantof the MariupolHussarRegiment. The tsar also granted him the surname "Alexandrov".[17]
In an era when Russian officers were expected to grow a mustache, Alexandrov's youthful appearance harmed his chances for promotion. He transferred away from the hussars to the Lithuanian Uhlan Regiment in order to avoid the colonel's daughter, who had fallen in love with him. He saw action again duringNapoleon's invasion of Russiain 1812. He fought in theBattle of Smolensk. During theBattle of Borodino, acannonballwounded him in the leg, yet he continued serving full duty for several days afterwards until ordered away to recuperate. He retired from the army in 1816 with the rank ofstabs-rotmistr("staff riding master"), the equivalent ofcaptain lieutenant.[17]

Writings
Twenty years later, Alexandrov met writerAlexander Sergeyevich Pushkin. Upon learning that Alexandrov had kept a journal of his army service, Pushkin encouraged him to publish it as a memoir. Alexandrov added background about his early childhood, adjusted his age by seven years, and omitted any reference to his marriage. He wished to publish it as "Notes of Alexandrov", but Pushkin changed the title without his approval to "Notes of N.A. Durova" in 1836. An outraged Alexandrov wrote, "The name which you called me, dear sir Alexander Sergeyevich, in the preface haunts me! Is there no remedy for my grief? You called me by that name that makes me shudder, and soon 20,000 people will read it and call me by it too!"[4]When it was published as a book, editor and publisher Ivan Butovskii retitled it toThe Cavalry Maiden.[4]
Alexandrov also wrote five other novels.[18]

Later life
Alexandrov continued to wear male clothing for the rest of his life, continued to use his male name, and spoke using masculine grammar.[1]
He died inYelabugaon March 21, 1866, and was buried with full military honors.[17]His son, Ivan Durov, had died 10 years prior, in 1856.[15]

Legacy
"Notes" is one of the few sustained accounts of the Napoleonic wars to describe events from the perspective of a junior officer[citation needed]and one of the earliest autobiographical works inRussian literature.
Alexandrov became a figure of some cultural interest inEastern Europebut remained largely unknown in theAnglosphereuntilMary Zirin's 1988 English translation ofThe Cavalry Maiden. Alexandrov is now a subject of university syllabi and scholarly publications in comparative literature andRussian history.

Gender identity
Alexandrov'sgender identityhas been the subject of debate. Many historians andfeministscholars have described him as across-dressingwoman,[19]while some modern scholars say Alexandrov is better understood astransgender.[20]In "Notes", he describes himself with terms of androgyny, describing himself both as abogatyr[21]and as anAmazon warrior. One of his prose stories,Nurmeka, revolves around a male-to-female cross-dresser, leading to speculation that this was an expression of a trans identity.[22][23]
In his personal life, Alexandrov rejected femininity, and behaved as a man.[1][23]After leaving the army, he continued to prefer the masculine name Alexander Alexandrov, which he used with the approval of Tsar Aleksander I. Public records recording him as Aleksandrov include his military pension accounts, his will, and the record of his death in the parish registry books.[24]
