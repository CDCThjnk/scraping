Garneau resigned as the president of the Canadian Space Agency to run for the Liberal Party of Canada in the2006 federal electionin the riding ofVaudreuil—Soulanges, which was then held byMeili Failleof theBloc Québécois.[29]The Liberal Party's support dropped off considerably in Quebec after theSponsorship scandaland though considered astar candidate, Garneau lost to Faille by over 9,000 votes.[30][31]
In the2006 Liberal Party leadership electionGarneau announced his support for perceived front-runnerMichael Ignatieff, who lost toStéphane Dionon the final ballot.[32]With the resignation of Liberal MPJean Lapierrein 2007, Garneau expressed interest in being the party's candidate in Lapierre's former riding ofOutremont.[33]Dion instead appointedJocelyn Coulonas the party's candidate, who went on to be defeated by theNew Democratic Party'sThomas Mulcairin the by-election.[34]
In May 2007, Garneau filed nomination papers to be the party's candidate in Westmount—Ville-Marie, after former Liberal Party deputy leaderLucienne Robillardannounced she would not be seeking re-election. However, a week after filing his nomination papers Dion announced that he had hand-picked a candidate for the riding. Garneau later withdrew his nomination papers and announced he no longer had an interest in politics. In October 2007, Garneau and Dion held a joint news conference where they announced that Garneau would be the Liberal Party candidate in Westmount—Ville-Marie.[33]Robillard announced her resignation as Member of Parliament in January and a by-election was later scheduled for September 8, 2008.[35][36]However, the by-election was cancelled during the campaign when Prime MinisterStephen Harpercalled ageneral election for October 14, 2008. Though some pundits predicted a close race between Garneau and NDP candidateAnne Lagacé-Dowson, Garneau went on to win the riding by over 9,000 votes.[23][37]

Member of 40th Parliament
Garneau was a member of the Industry, Science and Technology committee of the 40th Parliament. He also served on the Canada-Japan interparliamentary group.[38]

41st Parliament and leadership campaign
Garneau was narrowly re-elected in the2011 electionwhere he beat New Democratic Party candidate Joanne Corbeil. He was Liberal House leader and served from 2013 as Liberal foreign affairs critic. He was a candidate for interim leadership of the Liberal Party, but was ultimately defeated byBob Rae.[39][40]Garneau announced later that year that he was considering a bid for the permanent leadership of the party.[41]In the summer of 2012, he announced that he was looking for a "dream team" to run his leadership bid and that he would only run if he could find the right people.[42][43]
On November 21, 2012, Garneau was named his party's natural resources critic afterDavid McGuintyresigned the post.[44]
On November 28, 2012, Garneau announced his bid for the leadership of the Liberal Party, placing a heavy focus on the economy.[45][46]While fellow leadership candidateJustin Trudeauwas widely seen as the front-runner in the race, Garneau was thought to be his main challenger among the candidates.[47]With his entrance into the leadership race he resigned his post as Liberal House leader, while remaining the party's critic for natural resources.[48]
At the press conference announcing his candidacy Garneau ruled out any form of co-operation with theGreen PartyorNew Democratic Partyto help defeat theConservative Partyin the next election, which was proposed by leadership candidateJoyce Murray.[49]
On January 30, 2013, Garneau was replaced as natural resources critic byTed Hsu. Garneau had been serving in the position on an interim basis.[50]On March 13, 2013, Garneau announced his withdrawal from the race, and threw his support to front-runnerJustin Trudeau.

Two weeks later, on November 4, 2015, Garneau was appointed the minister of transport by Prime MinisterJustin Trudeau.[53]In May 2017, Garneau introduced an airline passenger bill of rights to standardize how passengers can be treated by airlines which operate any flights in and out of Canada. The legislation would create minimum compensation rates for overbooking, lost or damaged luggage, and bumping passengers off flights. It would also prohibit airlines from removing people from the flight if they have purchased a ticket and set the standard fortarmacdelays and airline treatment of passengers when flights are delayed or cancelled over events in the airline's control, or because of weather conditions.[54]
In March 2019, after days of initial refusal to take actions following the crash ofEthiopian Airlines Flight 302, Garneau who had even gone so far as to say on March 11 that he would board a 737 MAX 8 "without hesitation" as an apparent show of support for theBoeingCompany,[55]finally agreed on March 13 togroundand prohibit allBoeing 737 MAXaircraft from flying in Canadian airspace.[56]TheTrump administrationfollowed suit later that day.[57]This stood in contrast to the ministry's previous stance, where Garneau insisted the plane was safe to fly, thus making Canada one of the only two nations still flying a substantial number of Boeing 737 MAX planes at the time.[58][59]

Minister of Foreign Affairs in the 43rd Parliament
Garneau continued to serve as Minister of Transport after the elections to the 43rd Parliament held in October 2019. He was at Transport for the first two years of theCovid-19 pandemic, and thus he was responsible to enforce theQuarantine Actas lieutenant to the Minister of HealthPatty Hajdu; during this time he made many decisions that would affect the lives of travellers in co-ordination with Hadju.[60][61][62]
Garneau then served as Minister of Foreign Affairs from January 12, 2021, until October 26, 2021.[38]On January 12, 2021, following the resignation ofNavdeep Bainsasminister of innovation, science and industry, Prime MinisterJustin Trudeaushuffled the Cabinet, with Garneau becoming Minister of Foreign Affairs andOmar Alghabrataking his place at Transport.[63]Garneau was described as one of the most qualified and capable members of Cabinet.[64][65][66]

44th Parliament
Following the cabinet shuffle stemming from theelection in October 2021, Garneau was dropped from Cabinet on October 26, despite being re-elected to his seat in the House.[67]Some speculated that Garneau did not remain in cabinet due to his age, being sacrificed in the name of gender parity, and that he reportedly refused to be subservient to the Prime Minister's Office.[64][65][66]
On March 8, 2023, Garneau announced that he would resign his seat and retire from politics.[68]He gave his farewell speech in theHouse of Commonsthe same day.[69][70]Theby-electionto replace him in parliament occurred June 19, 2023.[71]LiberalAnna Gaineysucceeded him, with almost as big a majority of votes as Garneau had won previously.[72]

Retirement and death
In retirement, Garneau continued to advocate for the advantages of human spaceflight in building space infrastructure for monitoring the planet and for communications.[73]In autumn 2024, Garneau's autobiography,A Most Extraordinary Ride: Space, Politics and the Pursuit of a Canadian Dreamwas published in Canada.[74]
