Roger Keith Crouch(born September 12, 1940) is an American scientist andastronautwho flew as apayload specialiston twoNASASpace Shuttlemissions in 1997.

Personal
Born September 12, 1940, inJamestown, Tennessee, Crouch currently resides inWashington, D.C., with his wife, the former Anne Novotny. He has three grown children, Melanie, Kevin and Kenyon. His mother, Maxine Crouch, resides in Jamestown, Tennessee. He enjoystraveling,photography,sports,camping,hiking,fishingandwhitewater rafting.[1]Crouch is anEagle Scout.[2][3][4]

Education
Crouch attended high school atAlvin C. York Institute. He earned aBachelor of ScienceinphysicsfromTennessee Polytechnic Institutein 1962,Masterof Science and aDoctor of Philosophyin physics fromVirginia Polytechnic Institutein 1968 and 1971, respectively.[1]

Career
On loan fromMITtoNASA Headquartersas the Senior Scientist for theInternational Space Stationsince 2000; prior to that, on loan from MIT as the Senior Scientist for theOffice of Life and Microgravity Sciences, NASA-HQ, 1998–2000; crew training, flight and post-flight activities 1996–1998; Lead Scientist of theMicrogravity Space and Applications Divisionsince 1985–1996. He served as Program Scientist on five differentSpacelabflights. In addition, he helped organize and has served as co-chair forMicrogravity Science Working Groupsbetween NASA andspace agenciesfrom theEuropean Union, France, Germany, Japan, and Russia. He was the founding co-chair of theInternational Microgravity Science Strategic Planning Groupconsisting of these space agencies plus Canada. He was principal investigator on an experiment that flew in theMaterials Experiment Apparatuson theD-1mission in 1985. Group leader and researcher, NASALangley Research Center, 1962–1985. Leader of a research group investigating the effects ofconvectiononsemiconductormaterials' properties. He was a principal investigator in theMSADflight program from 1986 to 1997. He has done research in various techniques and types ofsemiconductor crystal growth,electricandopticalproperties of materials, electronic devices for remote sensing andflat panel displays, andheat shieldprotection foratmospheric reentryof space vehicles. This research resulted in the publication of over 40 technical paper and over 50 technical conference reports. He trained as the Alternate Payload Specialist forSTS-42(First International Microgravity Laboratory) which flew in January 1992.[1]

Spaceflight experience
Flew as a payload specialist onSTS-83(April 4–8, 1997) andSTS-94(July 1–17, 1997) and logged over 471 hours in space. STS-83, theMicrogravity Science Laboratory(MSL-1) Spacelab mission, was cut short because of problems with one of theShuttle’s fuel cell power units. Mission duration was 95 hours and 12 minutes, traveling 1.5 million miles in 63 orbits. STS-94 was a reflight of the MSL-1 and focused on materials and combustion science research. Mission duration was 376 hours and 45 minutes, traveling 6.3 million miles in 251 orbits of the Earth.[1]

Special honors and organizations
