Career
Following graduation from Purdue University he worked as acivil engineeringtechnician, land acquisition specialist andforest firefighterfor theU.S. Forest Service. Subsequently, he was a design engineer with theBendixAerospace Company where he worked on aerodynamic analysis, missile subsystem design, and flight testing. He also was employed as project engineer with the Naval Sea Systems Command with responsibility for computer-controlled manufacturing systems.
Walker applied for the1978 astronaut classbut was unsuccessful, as he was neither affiliated with a major university nor had a PhD. He saw the newPayload Specialistprogram as another way to fly in space, and sought a job that might give him the opportunity to serve as one.[2]He joined theMcDonnell DouglasCorporation in 1977 as a test engineer on the Aft Propulsion Subsystem for theSpace Shuttleorbiters, then the company's Space Manufacturing (later namedElectrophoresisOperations in Space, EOS) team as one of its original members. Walker shares in a patent for the McDonnell Douglas-developed continuous flow electrophoresis (CFES) device. McDonnell Douglas' main partner wasOrtho Pharmaceutical, which hoped to manufacture large amounts of purifiederythropoietinin space.[3]
From 1979 to 1986, Walker was chief test engineer and payload specialist for the McDonnell Douglas EOS commercialization project, having told company management that he was interested in flying in space if possible.[2]Walker led the EOS laboratory test and operations team developing biomedical products. His contributions to the program included engineering planning, design and development, product research, and space flight and evaluation of the CFES device. Walker was involved with the program support activities atKennedy Space Center,Florida, and at the Mission Control Center inHouston, Texas. He was responsible for training theNASAastronautcrews in the operation of the CFES payload onSTS-4,STS-6,STS-7, andSTS-8shuttle flights during 1982 and 1983.[2]In May 1986, Walker was appointed Special Assistant to the President of McDonnell Douglas Space Systems Company, working inWashington, D.C.
Walker has been an industry member of the NASA Microgravity Material Science Assessment Task Force, the NASA Space Station Office Quick-is Beautiful/Rapid Response Research Study Group, and the NASA Space Station Operations Task Force. He has been a member of the National Research Council's Space Applications Board. Walker was Faculty Course Advisor and lecturer for the International Space university 1988 summer session. He was a participant in the 1988Center for Strategic and International Studies' civil Space policy study. He served on the AIAA steering committee formulating the strategic plan for NASA's office of Commercial Programs. Walker has served as a founding board member of theAstronauts Memorial Foundation. He was the organizing committee chairman for the 1992World Space Congress. He has been a national panel member of the NASA/Industry Manned Flight Awareness Program and the NASA/Industry Education Initiative. Walker advised the NASA/Purdue University space life support research center, a NASA/Penn State space commercial development center and aU.S. Department of Education/Ohio State Universityscience education center. He has been a board director of theChallenger Center for Space Science Education. Walker has served as the volunteer chairman of the board of directors of Spacecause, and is past president and board director of theNational Space Society. He has also been a board director of theAssociation of Space Explorers. As an advisor, Walker works with commercial space firms Space Adventures, Ltd and Deep Space Industries, Inc., and the Commercial Spaceflight Federation. Walker is a professional engineer registered in California. He has been an expert witness testifying before committees of the U.S. Congress. He has authored several papers and book contributions on the EOS electrophoresis program, space development, commercialization, and space history. Walker has also written columns and articles appearing in national newspapers and numerous other publications.
Walker retired in 2005 as the Director for NASA Systems Government Relations with the Washington D.C. Operations office of The Boeing Company.[1][4]In 2018, Walker, joinedSolstaras an advisor.[5]Walker is currently a consultant, author and lecturer.

NASA activities
STS-4 demonstrated the difficulty of Walker assisting astronauts with the complex CFES device. He and others could not speak directly to the space shuttle; thecapsule communicatorand two other people approved and relayed all messages to space. McDonnell Douglas proposed that Walker fly as a payload specialist to operate the CFES himself. NASA calculated that flying Walker would cost McDonnell Douglas $40,000 per flight, and in May 1983 he was assigned toSTS-41-D.[2][3]
Walker's flight was part of a NASA effort in the 1980s to fly civilians on the shuttle. Although Europeans were training forSpacelabPayload Specialist duties, Walker remained a McDonnell Douglas employee, and commuted between company headquarters inSt. Louis, Missouriand theJohnson Space CenterinHouston, Texas. Training included a flight on aNorthrop T-38 Talonjet trainer aircraft, and about 40 flights on the "Vomit Comet". He later stated that his experience showed that a "working passenger" could fly after an abbreviated training program of a few months.[2][6]
Although Walker believed at the time that 41-D would be his only flight,[7]he also accompanied the CFES equipment onSTS-51-D, andSTS-61-B, accumulating 20 days of experience in space and traveling 8.2 million miles. Aboard these Space Shuttle missions Walker also performed early protein crystal growth experiments and participated as a test subject in numerous medical studies. He began training fellow McDonnell Douglas employee Robert Wood to fly onSTS-61-Min 1986, and expected to fly at least once more himself, perhaps onSpace Station Freedom, before thedestruction ofChallengerin January 1986 ended commercial shuttle payloads.[8]
Since 1986 Walker has served in various NASA study and review team capacities including as a member of the NASA Microgravity Material Science Assessment Task Force, the NASA Space Station Office Quick-is-Beautiful/Rapid Response Research Study Group, the NASA Space Station Operations Task Force, and the International Space Station Strategic Roadmap Committee. He has served on the national panels of the NASA/Industry Manned Flight Awareness Program and the NASA/Industry Education Initiative. He also makes a public appearance occasionally to sign memorabilia at theKennedy Space Center Visitor Complexand also appears for the complex's "Lunch with an Astronaut" program.
