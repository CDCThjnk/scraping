Ellen Ochoa(born May 10, 1958) is an American engineer, former astronaut and former director of theJohnson Space Center.[1]In 1993, Ochoa became the firstLatinawoman to go to space when she served on a nine-day mission aboard theSpace ShuttleDiscovery.[2]Ochoa became director of the center upon the retirement of the previous director,Michael Coats, on December 31, 2012.[3]She was the first Latina director and the second female director of Johnson Space Center.

Early life and education
Ellen Lauri Ochoa was born on May 10, 1958, inLos Angeles, California,[4]to Joseph and Rosanne (née Deardorff) Ochoa. Her paternal grandparents emigrated fromSonora, Mexico, toArizonaand later to California where her father was born.[5]She grew up inLa Mesa, California.[1]Ochoa was the middle child of five and neither parent had college degrees.[6]
Ochoa graduated fromGrossmont High SchoolinEl Cajonin 1975. Her parents divorced when she was in high school and she lived with her mother and her brothers.[7]
Ochoa received a Bachelor of Science degree in physics fromSan Diego State University[8][9]and graduatedPhi Beta Kappain 1980, before earning a Master of Science degree and a doctorate fromStanford Department of Electrical Engineeringin 1981 and 1985, respectively.[10]During her time at San Diego State University she found that she loved physics, math, and engineering; ultimately, deciding to major in physics and electrical engineering from Stanford.[6]

Career

Research
As a doctoral student at Stanford, and later as a researcher atSandia National Laboratoriesand theNASA Ames Research Center, Ochoa investigated optical systems for performing information processing.[1]At the NASA Ames Research Center, she led a research group working primarily on optical systems for automated space exploration.[1]At Sandia National Laboratories, she applied what she knew about optics to the research being done on nuclear weapons.[6]She had three patents for her work in optical systems. The first patent was for an optical inspection system that was designed to detect defects in repeating patterns. This was beneficial to analyze impurities in materials such as semiconductors to help with quality control. Her second patent was for an automated inspection system. This system was also designed to analyze manufactured components for imperfections or defects. Her third patent was for a method and apparatus designed to recognize texture patterns from photos.[11][12][13]
Ochoa was enticed by optical systems and committed to improving its applications for performing information processing. She wanted to help computers "see". NASA later recognized her methods in optics could be used in fabricating such as inspecting for flaws, or it might be used on a space vehicle such as the Rover.[14]
As Chief of the Intelligent Systems Technology Branch at Ames, she supervised 35 engineers and scientists in the research and development of computational systems for aerospace missions. Ochoa has presented numerous papers at technical conferences.
She was selected as part of the 1990 class of astronauts.[6]
Ellen Ochoa was selected by NASA in January 1990 and became an astronaut in July 1991.[1]Her technical assignments in the Astronaut Office included serving as the crew representative for flight software, computer hardware and robotics, Assistant for Space Station to the Chief of the Astronaut Office, lead spacecraft communicator (CAPCOM) in Mission Control and acting as Deputy Chief of the Astronaut Office.[1]
Ochoa became the firstHispanicwoman to go to space[15][16]when she served on a nine-day mission aboard theSpace ShuttleDiscoveryin 1993. The purpose of the Shuttle mission was to study the Earth's ozone layer. A veteran of four space flights, Ochoa has logged nearly 1000 hours in space.[17]She was a mission specialist onSTS-56(1993), was payload commander onSTS-66, and was mission specialist and flight engineer onSTS-96andSTS-110in 2002.[1][18]Her third trip was for the STS-96 mission, which was a significant trip as it marked the first docking of a space shuttle with the International Space Station. On this mission, the crew delivered supplies, equipment, and performed a few experiments with the ISS. Dr. Ochoa's last trip was for the STS-110 mission, which was focused on the assembly of the ISS. Ochoa was in Mission Control during theSpace ShuttleColumbiadisasterand was one of the first personnel informed of television coverage showingColumbia's disintegration.[19]
From 2007, after retiring from spacecraft operations, Ochoa served as deputy director of NASA's Johnson Space Center, helping to manage and direct the Astronaut Office and Aircraft Operations. On January 1, 2013, Ochoa became the first Hispanic and second female director of the Johnson Space Center.[20]In November 2024, it was announced that she joined the board ofNvidia.[21]

National service
Ochoa was named vice chair of theNational Science Boardfor the 2018–2020 term. She currently chairs the committee evaluating nominations for theNational Medal of Technology and Innovation.[22]

Personal life
Ochoa's husband is Coe Miles, anintellectual propertyattorney.[23]They have two sons.[23]Ochoa is a classical flutist and played with the Stanford Symphony Orchestra, once receiving the Student Soloist Award.[24]While an undergraduate at San Diego State University, she played the flute for two years as part of the university marching band and for five years as a member of the university wind ensemble. She took a flute with her on her first mission to space.[25]

Recognition
The Ochoa Middle School located inPasco, Washington, the Ellen Ochoa Elementary School inCudahy, California, and the Ánimo Ellen Ochoa Charter Middle School inEast Los Angelesare named in her honor. In addition, Grand Prairie, Texas has the Ellen Ochoa STEM Academy at Ben Milam Elementary School and Pico Rivera, California has theEllen Ochoa Prep Academy.[26]Union Public Schools in Tulsa named a new elementary school after her as well,[27]as did the school system in Passaic, New Jersey.[28]
A flag with the rocket logo of the Ochoa Middle School in Pasco, Washington, flew with Ochoa in April 2002 aboard the ShuttleAtlantisfor an 11-day mission to the International Space Station. Ochoa returned the flag to the school when she visited as a special guest at the 2002 dedication and it remains on permanent display.[29]
Ochoa has received many awards among which are NASA's Distinguished Service Medal (2015),[30]Exceptional Service Medal (1997), Outstanding Leadership Medal (1995) and Space Flight Medals (2002, 1999, 1994, 1993).[1]Ochoa andMichael Foalewere announced as the 2017 class of theUnited States Astronaut Hall of Fame.[31]Ochoa was recognized inHispanic Executive's 2017 Best of the Boardroom[32]issue for her work as a board director for Johnson Space Center. She was inducted into the 2018 International Air and Space Hall of Fame class.[33]
Ochoa is a Fellow ofAmerican Association for the Advancement of Science, theAmerican Institute of Aeronautics and Astronautics, theNational Academy of Inventors,[22]andOptica.[34]
An animated version of Ochoa was featured in the 2019 episode "Astronaut Ellen Ochoa" of the children's television program,Ready Jet Go!.[35]In 2024, Ochoa was awarded thePresidential Medal of Freedomby PresidentJoe Biden.[36]
