After serving with the82nd Airborne DivisionatFort Bragg, North Carolina, McArthur attended theU.S. Army Aviation Schooland served tours of duty in Korea and Georgia, where he earned aMaster of Sciencedegree inAerospace Engineeringfrom theGeorgia Institute of Technologyin 1983.[1]

NASA career
In 1987, McArthur attended theU.S. Naval Test Pilot Schooland was trained as an experimentaltest pilot. He was assigned to a post as aflight test engineeratNASAand was selected as an astronaut candidate in 1990. McArthur's first spaceflight was in 1993 aboardSTS-58. Subsequent missions includedSTS-74in 1995 andSTS-92in 2000.[1]
AMaster Army Aviator, McArthur has logged over 9,000 flight hours in 41 different aircraft and spacecraft.
McArthur is the recipient of a number of prestigious awards and honors including theArmy Distinguished Service Medal, theDefense Superior Service Medal, theDefense Meritorious Service Medal(Oak leaf cluster), theNASA Distinguished Service Medal, theNASA Exceptional Service Medaland theNASA Space Flight Medal. He retired from the U.S. Army in 2001.[1]

McArthur served as the Director of Safety and Mission Assurance for theJohnson Space Centeruntil his retirement in June of 2017.[1]

Expedition 12
In April 2006, McArthur andExpedition 13flight officerJeffrey Williamstested a new method of preparing forspacewalksby "camping out" or spending the night in theQuest airlock, the decompression capsule through which astronauts enter and exit space. In the chamber the pressure was reduced from the normal 14.7 pounds per square inch (psi) to 10.2 psi. The more commonly used method of preparing for spacewalks involves breathing pure oxygen for several hours to purge the body of nitrogen and avoidthe bends. The "campout" method was intended to shorten that lengthy preparation time. Four hours into their sleep an error tone prompted mission controllers to cut short the activity, though it was still deemed a success.[3]

Personal life
McArthur is married to the former Cynthia Kathryn Lovin[4]with two daughters, and enjoys cycling, photography, and working with personal computers.[1]In May 2009 he was awarded an honorary doctorate from theUniversity of Strathclydein recognition of his contribution to space science and engineering, as well as his outreach work with theScottish Space School.[5]He resides inFriendswood, Texas.
