Ronald Michael "Ron" Sega(born December 4, 1952) is an American former astronaut who is professor of systems engineering and Vice President for Energy and the Environment at theColorado State UniversityResearch Foundation, a non-profit advocacy organization supporting CSU.[1]He is also the Vice President and Enterprise Executive for Energy and Environment atOhio State University.[2]From August 2005 to August 2007, he served asUnder Secretary of the Air Force.  He is a retiredmajor generalin theUnited States Air Forceand a formerNASAastronaut.  Sega was born inCleveland, Ohio, he is ofSloveneorigin. He was married to fellow astronautBonnie J. Dunbar.[3]He is now married to Ann Sega and they have two sons. He has lived in bothNorthfield, OhioandColorado Springs.[4]

Education
Sega graduated fromNordonia High School,Macedonia, Ohio, in 1970 after which he received aBachelor of Sciencedegree inmathematicsandphysicsfrom theUnited States Air Force Academyin 1974, aMaster of Sciencedegree inphysicsfromOhio State Universityin 1975, and adoctorateinelectrical engineeringfromUniversity of Colorado at Boulderin 1982.

Career
Sega completed pilot training in 1976 and served as an Instructor Pilot atWilliams Air Force Base,Arizona, until 1979. From 1979 to 1982 he was on the faculty of theUnited States Air Force Academyin the physics department where he designed and constructed a laboratory facility to investigate microwave fields using infrared techniques while pursuing a doctorate in electrical engineering. In 1982 he joined the faculty of theUniversity of Colorado at Colorado Springsas assistant professor in the Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering. He was promoted to associate professor in 1985, granted tenure in 1988, promoted to professor in 1990, and is currently on an extended leave of absence.[5]From 1987 to 1988 he served as Technical Director, Lasers and Aerospace Mechanics Directorate, of the Frank J. Seiler Research Laboratory at the U.S. Air Force Academy. From 1989 to 1990, while on leave from the University of Colorado, he served as Research Associate Professor of Physics at theUniversity of Houston, affiliated with theSpace Vacuum Epitaxy Center, and is adjunct professor of physics. Sega is a co-principal investigator and mission director for theWake Shield Facility(WSF) which has flown onSpace ShuttlemissionSTS-60in February 1994 andSTS-76in 1996. He has authored or co-authored over 100 technical publications.[5]
As a pilot, Sega has logged over 4,000 hours in the Air Force, Air Force Reserves and NASA.[5]

NASA career
Sega became an astronaut in July 1991 after selection in 1990. His technical assignments included:
 - working Remote Manipulator System (RMS) issues for the Astronaut Office Mission Development Branch
 - supporting Orbiter software verification in theShuttle Avionics Integration Laboratory(SAIL)
 - Chief of Astronaut Appearances
 - Science Support Group Lead
 - Space Station integration team
 - Astronaut Representative to the Space Station Science and Utilization Advisory Board (primarily an external board for NASA).
From November 1994 to March 1995, Sega was the NASA Director of Operations,Star City, Russia(TheGagarin Cosmonaut Training Center) responsible for managing NASA activities at Star City. These activities involved building an organization and infrastructure to support astronaut and cosmonaut mission and science training for flight on the Russian Space StationMir. He also participated in training on Russian Space Systems and was the first American to train in the Russian EVA suit (Orlan) in their underwater facility (Hydrolaboratory). A veteran of two space flights (STS-60in 1994 andSTS-76in 1996), Sega logged over 420 hours in space.
STS-60was the first joint United States/RussianSpace Shuttlemission. Launched on February 3, 1994, STS-60 was the second flight of theSpace Habitation Module-2 (Spacehab-2), and the first flight of theWake Shield Facility(WSF-1). During the 8-day flight, the crew ofDiscoveryconducted a wide variety of biological, materials science, earth observation, and life science experiments. Sega was the flight engineer for ascent and entry on this mission, performed several experiments on orbit, and operated the robotic arm, berthing the Wake Shield onto its payload bay carrier on four separate occasions. Following 130 orbits of the Earth in 3,439,705 miles, STS-60 landed atKennedy Space Center,Florida, on February 11, 1994. With the completion of his first space flight, Sega logged 8 days, 7 hours, 9 minutes in space.[5]
STS-76, the third docking mission to the Russian space stationMir, launched at night on March 22, 1996, with a crew of six aboardAtlantis. Following rendezvous and docking with Mir, aNASAastronaut transferred to Mir for a five-month stay to begin a continuous presence of U.S. astronauts aboard Mir for the next two years. Sega was the payload commander for this mission and lead on Biorack, a small multipurpose laboratory located in theSpacehabmodule carried in the Shuttle payload bay. Biorack was used to technology development, fundamental biology (research into plant and animal cellular function), and environment characterization. He was responsible for planning and on-orbit operations, including extensive transfer of logistics and science, including 4800 pounds of science and mission hardware, food, water and air to Mir, and returning over 1100 pounds of U.S. andESAscience and Russian hardware. Following 144 orbits of the Earth,Atlantislanded with a crew of five atEdwards Air Force BaseinCaliforniaon March 31, 1996. Mission duration was 9 days, 5 hours, 15 minutes.[5]

Post-NASA career
Sega left NASA on July 1, 1996, to become Dean of the College of Engineering and Applied Science,University of Colorado at Colorado Springs.[5]In 2001, he became acting Assistant to the Secretary of Defense for Nuclear, Chemical and Biological Programs.
Sega served asAssistant Secretary of Defense for Research and Engineering, from August 2001 through August 2005.
The Defense Research and Engineering was made byPaul Wolfowitzthe key compliance officer regarding, among others, the protection of human subjects in DoD supported research.
In the same period, he also served as the Reserve Assistant to the Chairman, Joint Chiefs of StaffJCS. According to theSenate Armed Services Committee Report of the Inquiry into the Treatment of Detainees in U.S. Custody,[6]The Joint Chiefs were involved in the approval of the controversialinterrogation programboth the DoD and the CIA engaged.[7][8]
In January 2004,  during Sega's tenure as director, a DoD-wide review of human subjects protection policies was initiated by Defense Research and Engineering (DDR&E).
On November 14, 2006, ANavypresentation at a DoD Training Day said the review found the Navy "not in full compliance with Federal policies on human subjects protection." It was pointed out that the Navy had "no single point of accountability for human subject protections."[7]
In 2005 he becameUnder Secretary of the Air Force, thus serving as Department of Defense Executive Agent and Milestone Decision Authority for Space.
Starting in 2007, he worked at the Colorado State University, where Sega has "served as Vice President of Energy and the Environment for the Colorado State University Research Foundation, a private, non-profit advocacy organization for the university, and as the Woodward Professor of Systems Engineering in the College of Engineering".[9]In September 2010, Colorado State University and The Ohio State University collaborated to create a shared position called the Vice President and Enterprise Executive for Energy and the Environment. In this position, Sega "will help the institutions work together to identify and lead potential national initiatives and economic development opportunities and will also look for opportunities for collaboration between the universities."[10]
