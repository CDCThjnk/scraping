Nancy Jan Davis(néeSmotherman; born November 1, 1953) is a former Americanastronaut. A veteran of three space flights, Davis logged over 673 hours in space. She is now retired fromNASA.[1][2]

Early life
Nancy Jan Davis graduated fromHuntsville High Schoolin 1971,[3]received aBachelor of Sciencedegree inapplied biologyfrom theGeorgia Institute of Technologyin 1975 and another inmechanical engineeringfromAuburn Universityin 1977.[3]She received aMaster of Sciencedegree in 1983 and adoctoratein 1985, both in mechanical engineering at theUniversity of Alabama in Huntsville.[4]

Engineering career
After graduating fromAuburn Universityin 1977, Davis joinedTexacoinBellaire, Texas, working as apetroleum engineerin tertiary oil recovery. She left there in 1979 to work for NASA'sMarshall Space Flight Centeras anaerospace engineer. In 1986, she was named as team leader in the Structural Analysis Division, and her team was responsible for thestructural analysisand verification of theHubble Space Telescope(HST), the HST maintenance mission, and theAdvanced X-Ray Astrophysics Facility. In 1987, she was also assigned to be the lead engineer for the redesign of the solid rocket booster external tank attach ring. Davis did her graduate research at the University of Alabama in Huntsville, studying the long-term strength of pressure vessels due to theviscoelasticcharacteristics of filament-woundcomposites. She holds one patent, has authored several technical papers, and is a Registered Professional Engineer.[2]

Astronaut career
Davis became an astronaut in June 1987.[2]Her first assignment was in the Astronaut Office Mission Development Branch, where she provided technical support forSpace Shuttlepayloads.[5]Following this, Davis was a CAPCOM in Mission Control, responsible for communicating with Shuttle crews for seven missions. After her first space flight, Davis served as the Astronaut Office representative for theRemote Manipulator System(RMS), with responsibility for RMS operations, training, and payloads. After her second space flight, she served as the Chairperson of the NASA Education Working Group and as Chief for the Payloads Branch, which provided Astronaut Office support for all Shuttle andInternational Space Stationpayloads. A veteran of three space flights, Davis has logged over 673 hours in space. She flew as amission specialistonSTS-47in 1992 andSTS-60in 1994, and was the payload commander onSTS-85in 1997.[6]

STS-47
STS-47,Spacelab-J, was the 50th Space Shuttle mission. Launched on September 12, 1992,[7]this cooperative venture between the United States and Japan conducted 43 experiments in life sciences and materials processing. During the eight-day mission, she was responsible for operating Spacelab and its subsystems and performing a variety of experiments. Davis's then-husbandMark C. Leewas payload commander onSTS-47. After completing 126 orbits of the Earth,STS-47Endeavourlanded atKennedy Space Centeron September 20, 1992.[8]

STS-60
STS-60was the second flight ofSpacehab(Space Habitation Module) and the first flight of theWake Shield Facility(WSF). Launched on February 3, 1994, this flight was the first Space Shuttle flight on which a Russiancosmonautwas a crew member. During the eight-day mission, her prime responsibility was to maneuver the WSF on the RMS, to conductthin film crystalgrowth and she was also responsible for performing scientific experiments in the Spacehab. The STS-60Discoverylanded at Kennedy Space Center on February 11, 1994, after completing 130 orbits of the Earth.[9]

STS-85
Davis was the payload commander forSTS-85, which was launched onDiscoveryon August 7, 1997. During this 12-day mission, Davis deployed and retrieved theCRISTA-SPASpayload, and operated the Japanese Manipulator Flight Demonstration (MFD) robotic arm. The mission also included several other scientific payloads for the conduct of research onastronomy,Earth sciences,life sciences, andmaterials science. The mission was accomplished in 189 Earth orbits, traveling 4.7 million miles. The STS-85Discoverylanded at Kennedy Space Center on August 19, 1997.[10]

Later NASA career
After her flight on STS-85, Davis was assigned to NASA Headquarters as the Director of theHuman Exploration and Development of Space(HEDS), Independent Assurance Office for the Office of Safety and Mission Assurance. In that position, Davis managed and directed independent assessments for the programs and projects assigned to the HEDS enterprise. In July 1999, she transferred to the Marshall Space Flight Center as Director of the Flight Projects Directorate, which was responsible for the International Space Station (ISS) Payload Operations Center, ISS hardware and theChandra X-ray ObservatoryProgram. After theColumbiaaccident, she was named head of Safety and Mission Assurance at Marshall, where she assured the safe return to flight of the Space Shuttle.[2]Davis retired from NASA in 2005 and worked forJacobs Engineering Groupas a Vice President and Deputy General Manager.[2]She currently works for Bastion Technologies, Inc. as the Safety and Mission Assurance Support Contract Program Manager at the Marshall Space Flight Center.[11]
In 2023, Davis authored her first book "Air Born - Two Generations in Flight", about her father who was a WWII B-17 pilot and POW, and her own space flight career, using comparisons of their two careers.[12]In 2024, she published a companion book to the first, "Air Born - Artistic Musings of a WWII Pilot and POW," which includes her father's POW Wartime Log and the 96 PENNY cartoon he drew for the Stalag Luft III newspaper.

Personal life
Davis married fellow astronautMark C. Lee, in January 1991.[13]They were the first married couple to fly together in space, joined in 2022 by Sharon and Marc Hagle onBlue Origin's NS-20. They divorced in 1999.[14]
She is married to former Judge Schuyler Richardson.[15]

Medals and honors
She has been awarded theNASA Outstanding Leadership Medalin 1998,[5]theNASA Exceptional Service Medalin 1995 and 2002,[2]and theNASA Space Flight Medalin 1992, 1994, and 1997, the NASA Fellowship for Full-Time Study in 1983, the ASME National Old Guard Prize in 1978, the ASME Ralph Coates Roe Medal in 2001. She has been inducted to theAlabama Aviation Hall of Fame, the Alabama Engineering Hall of Fame,[3]and thePresidential Rank Award of Meritorious Executive.[16]
