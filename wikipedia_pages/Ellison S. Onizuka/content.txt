He died in thedestructionof theSpace ShuttleChallenger, on which he was serving asMission Specialistfor missionSTS-51-L. Onizuka was thefirst Asian Americanand the first person of Japanese ancestry to reach space.[1][2]

Early life
Onizuka was born on June 24, 1946, toJapanese Americanparents Masamitsu and Mitsue Onizuka. He was aBuddhist. Onizuka had two older sisters, Shirley and Norma, and a younger brother, Claude, who became the family spokesman after theChallengerdisaster.[3][4]Growing up, Onizuka was an active participant inFFA,[5]4-H, and theBoy Scouts of America, where he reached the level ofEagle Scout.[6]
Onizuka graduated fromKonawaena High Schoolin 1964. He received aBachelor of Sciencedegree inAerospace Engineeringin June 1969, and aMaster of Sciencedegree in that field in December of the same year, from theUniversity of Colorado at Boulder. Onizuka participated in theAir Force Reserve Officer Training Corpsduring his time there and is an alumnus ofTriangle Fraternity, the AFROTCArnold Air Society, as well as a member of theTau Beta Pihonor society.
Onizuka married Lorna Leiko Yoshida on June 7, 1969,[7]while completing his studies at the University of Colorado. They had two daughters, Janelle Onizuka-Gillilan (b. 1969) and Darien Lei Shizue Onizuka-Morgan (b. 1975).

Air Force career
On January 15, 1970, Onizuka entered active duty with the United States Air Force,[8]where he served as aflight test engineerat Sacramento Air Logistics Center atMcClellan Air Force Base. He worked in test flight programs and systems security engineering for theF-84,F-100,F-105,F-111,EC-121T,T-33,T-39,T-28, andA-1.
From August 1974 to July 1975, Onizuka attended theU.S. Air Force Test Pilot School. In July 1975, he was assigned to the Flight Test Center atEdwards Air Force BaseinCalifornia.[9]Onizuka became a squadron flight test engineer at the USAF Test Pilot School and later worked as a manager for engineering support in the training resources division. His duties there consisted of course instruction and management of the airship fleet (A-7,A-37,T-38,F-4,T-33, andNKC-135) being used for the Test Pilot School and Flight Test Center. While at the school, Onizuka registered more than 1,700 flight hours.[10]

NASA career
Onizuka was selected for the astronaut program in January 1978 and completed one year of evaluation and training in August 1979.[11]Later, he worked in the experimentation team, Orbiter test team, and launch support crew atKennedy Space Centerfor the STS-1 and STS-2. At NASA, Onizuka worked on theShuttle Avionics Integration Laboratory(SAIL) test and revision software team.
Onizuka's first space mission took place on January 24, 1985, with the launch of missionSTS-51-ConSpace ShuttleDiscovery, the first Space Shuttle mission for theDepartment of Defense.[12]He was accompanied by CommanderKen Mattingly, PilotLoren Shriver, fellowMission SpecialistJames Buchli, andPayload SpecialistGary E. Payton. During the mission, Onizuka was responsible for the activities of the primary payloads, which included the unfolding of the Inertial Upper Stage (IUS) surface. After 48 orbits around the Earth,Discoverylanded at Kennedy Space Center on January 27, 1985. Onizuka had completed a total of 74 hours inspace.[10]
Onizuka was assigned to the missionSTS-51-Lon theSpace ShuttleChallengerthat took off from Kennedy Space Center at 11:38:00 EST (16:38:00 UTC) on January 28, 1986. The otherChallengercrew members were commanderDick Scobee, pilotMichael J. Smith, mission specialistsRonald McNair,Judith Resnik, and payload specialistsGregory JarvisandChrista McAuliffe. The shuttle was destroyed when a flame jet leaking from a solid rocket booster ruptured the liquid hydrogen fuel tank 73 seconds after launch. All seven crew members were killed.
Following theChallengerdisaster, examination of the recovered vehicle cockpit revealed that three of the crew members'Personal Egress Air Packswere activated: those of Onizuka, Resnik, and Smith. The location of Smith's activation switch, on the back side of his seat, means that either Resnik or Onizuka could have activated it for him. This is the only evidence available from the disaster that shows Onizuka and Resnik were alive after the cockpit separated from the vehicle. However, if the cabin had lost pressure, the packs alone would not have sustained the crew during the two-minute descent.[13]
Onizuka is buried at theNational Memorial Cemetery of the PacificinHonolulu.[8]At the time of his death, he held the rank oflieutenant colonel. Onizuka wasposthumouslypromoted to the rank ofcolonel.[14]

Memberships and distinctions
Onizuka belonged to the following organizations: Society of Flight Test Engineers, theAir Force Association, theAmerican Institute of Aeronautics and Astronautics,Tau Beta Pi,Sigma Tau,Arnold Air Society, andTriangle Fraternity.
Among Onizuka's distinctions are theAir Force Meritorious Service Medal,Air Force Commendation Medal,Air Force Outstanding Unit Award,Air Force Organizational Excellence Award,National Defense Service Medal,Air and Space Longevity Service Award, andNASA Space Flight Medal. He was posthumously awarded theCongressional Space Medal of Honor.

Legacy
Onizuka Air Force Station[15](defunct as of 2010) inSunnyvale, California, and Onizuka Village family housing on Hickam Air Force Base are dedicated to Onizuka.[16]
The Ellison S. Onizuka Space Center atKona International Airportin theKona districtofHawaiʻi islandwhere he was born and raised, was dedicated to him. The center closed in March 2016 and was unable to find a suitable location to reopen. Select items from the center's collection have been put on permanent display at theJapanese Cultural Center of HawaiiinMōʻiliʻilion the island of Oahu. They not only feature Onizuka's personal items, but also the onlyMoon rockin Hawaii and the space suit from Apollo 13 astronautFred Haise.

His younger daughter, Darien Lei, was at Whitcomb.) In addition, Onizuka Street in Little Tokyo has a scale replica of theChallengeras a memorial, and a permanent memorial to Onizuka is located in the lobby of the Hompa Hongwanji Buddhist Temple.[17]
TheOnizuka Center for International Astronomy, named in Onizuka's honor, is the mid-level support and visitor complex for theMauna Kea Observatoriesin Hawaii. It includes a Visitor Information Station as well as dining, lodging, office, and maintenance facilities for observatory staff and astronomers.[18]A plaque of his face is mounted on a boulder by the entrance to the Visitor Information Station.Triangle Fraternityhas the Ellison Onizuka Young Alumnus Award in tribute to him.
The Ann & H.J. Smead Aerospace Engineering Sciences building at the University of Colorado at Boulder features a conference room named after Onizuka on the third floor. TheArnold Air SocietySquadron attached to the 105thAir Force Reserve Officer Training CorpsDetachment at the University of Colorado at Boulder bears his name.[19]
Page 28 (Page X of additional page inserts, or page 52 of the extended length version) of every new standard U.S. passport contains this quotation: "Every generation has the obligation to free men's minds for a look at new worlds ... to look out from a higher plateau than the last generation." – Ellison Onizuka

The students at the United States Air Force Test Pilot School present theOnizuka Prop Wash Awardto the classmate who contributed most to class spirit and morale.[23]
On January 1, 2017, the airport in Onizuka's home district of Kona was renamed Ellison OnizukaKona International Airportat Keāhole.[24]

It was given to Ellison on behalf of the soccer team that he coached, and for which his children played, to be brought into space. The ball was retrieved during the recovery efforts and donated to the school. In 2016,Col. Robert KimbroughonExpedition 49/50brought the ball into space.[25]
ACygnusresupply vehicle onISSresupply missionCygnus NG-16was named theSS Ellison Onizukain his honor.[26]It launched on August 10, 2021, and arrived at the ISS on August 12.
