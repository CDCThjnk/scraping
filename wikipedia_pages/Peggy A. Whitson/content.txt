Peggy Annette Whitson(born February 9, 1960) is an Americanbiochemistryresearcher, and astronaut working forAxiom Space. She retired fromNASAin 2018, after serving asChief Astronaut.[3]Over all her missions, Whitson has accumulated a total of 695 days in space, more than any other American or woman.[4][5]
Her first NASA space mission was in 2002: an extended stay aboard theInternational Space Station(ISS) as a crew member ofExpedition 5. On her second mission,Expedition 16in 2007-2008, she became the first woman to command the ISS.[6][7]In 2009, she became the first woman to serve as NASA's Chief Astronaut, the most senior position in theNASA Astronaut Corps.[8]In 2017, Whitson became the first woman to command theInternational Space Stationtwice. Her 289-day flight was thelongest single space flight by a woman[9][10]untilChristina Koch's 328-day flight.[11]
Whitson holds the records for the oldest woman spacewalker and the most spacewalks by a woman (10).[12][13]Whitson's cumulative EVA time is 60 hours, 21 minutes, which places her in fifth place fortotal EVA time.[1]At age 57 on her final NASA flight, she was the oldest woman ever in space at that time - a record broken in a 2021 sub-orbital flight byWally Funk. She is still the oldest woman to orbit the Earth, a record she set in 2025, at 65.[14][failed verification]
On June 15, 2018, Whitson retired from NASA. She later became a consultant forAxiom Space.[15]She served as the commander ofAxiom Mission 2in 2023[16]andAxiom Mission 4in 2025.
Whitson was included inTimemagazine's100 Most Influential People of 2018.[17]

Early life and background
Whitson grew up on a farm outside the town ofBeaconsfield, Iowa, with her sister, Kathy, her brothers, Brian and Hugh, and her parents, Keith and Beth.[3][18]Her parents were farmers. She decided to become an astronaut after she watched thefirst Moon landingon television as a child in 1969.[19]Whitson graduated fromMount Ayr Community High Schoolin 1978 and received a Bachelor of Science degree inbiologyandchemistryfromIowa Wesleyan Collegein 1981. She then went on to earn her doctorate degree inbiochemistryfromRice Universityin 1986[20]under the direction ofKathleen Matthews,[21]then continued at Rice as a Robert A Welch Post-doctoral Fellow until October 1986. She is married to Clarence F. Sams.[3]

Research career
After her fellowship at Rice, she began working atJohnson Space CenterinHouston, Texas, as a National Research Council Resident Research Associate. From April 1988 until September 1989, Whitson served as the Supervisor for the Biochemistry Research Group at KRUG International, a medical sciences contractor at NASA-JSC.[3]
From 1991 through 1997, Whitson became an adjunct assistant professor in the Department of Internal Medicine and the Department of Human Biological Chemistry and Genetics at theUniversity of Texas Medical BranchinGalveston, Texas. In 1997, Whitson began teaching as adjunct assistant professor at Rice University in the Maybee Laboratory for Biochemical and Genetic Engineering.[3]
From 1992 to 1995, she served as project scientist for theShuttle-Mir Program, then until 1996, as deputy division chief for the Medical Sciences division at theJohnson Space Center.[3]

NASA career
From 1989 to 1993, Whitson worked as a research biochemist in the Biomedical Operations and Research Branch at NASA-JSC. From 1991 to 1993, she served as technical monitor of the Biochemistry Research Laboratories in the Biomedical Operations and Research Branch. From 1991 through 1992, she was the payload element developer for Bone Cell Research Experiment (E10) aboard SL-J (STS-47), and was a member of the US-USSR Joint Working Group in Space Medicine and Biology. In 1992, she was named the project scientist of the Shuttle-Mir Program (STS-60,STS-63,STS-71,Mir 18,Mir 19), and served in this capacity until the conclusion of the Phase 1A Program in 1995. From 1993 through 1996, Whitson held the additional responsibilities of the deputy division chief of the Medical Sciences Division at NASA-JSC. From 1995 to 1996, she served as co-chair of the U.S.-Russian Mission Science Working Group.
In April 1996, Whitson was selected as an astronaut candidate; she started training in August 1996. Upon completing the two years of training and evaluation, she was assigned technical duties in the Astronaut Office Operations Planning Branch, and served as the lead for the Crew Test Support Team in Russia from 1998 to 1999.  In June 2003, Whitson commanded theNEEMO 5mission aboard theAquarius underwater laboratory, living and working underwater for 14 days.[22]From November 2003 to March 2005, she served as deputy chief of the Astronaut Office. From March 2005 to November 2005, she served as chief of the Station Operations Branch, Astronaut Office.

Chief of the Astronaut Office
Whitson was appointed NASA Chief of the Astronaut Office in October 2009, replacingSteven W. Lindsey. Whitson was the first female, and first non-pilot to serve as Chief Astronaut. She resigned when she went back on active flight status in July 2012, replaced byRobert Behnken. Whitson has also served twice as the commander of theInternational Space Station.[23][24]

Involvement with Axiom Space
She became the Director of Human Space Flight for Axiom Space in 2021.[15]In January 2021, Axiom announced she would be back-up commander ofAxiom Mission 1, raising the possibility that she could fly a later Axiom Space mission.[25][26]
On 21 May 2023, Whitson returned to space as the commander of the second Axiom missionAxiom Mission 2, docking with the ISS and spending 8 days in space.[16]She was again back-up commander ofAxiom Mission 3.[citation needed]
On 26 June 2025,[citation needed]Whitson served as the commander of the fourth Axiom missionAxiom Mission 4.

Spaceflight experience

Expedition 5
TheExpedition 5crew launched on June 5, 2002, aboard STS-111 and docked with the International Space Station on June 7, 2002. During her six-month stay aboard the Space Station, Whitson installed the Mobile Base System, the S1 truss segment, and the P1 truss segment using the space station remote manipulator system; performed a 4-hour and 25 minutespacewalkin a RussianOrlan space suitto install micrometeoroid shielding on theZvezdaService Module; and activated and checked out the Microgravity Sciences Glovebox, a facility class payload rack.
Whitson was named the first NASA science officer during her stay, and she conducted 21 investigations in human life sciences and microgravity sciences, as well as commercial payloads.[27]The Expedition 5 crew returned to Earth aboardSTS-113on December 7, 2002. Completing her first flight, Whitson logged 184 days, 22 hours and 14 minutes in space.

Expedition 16
Her second mission,Expedition 16, launched October 10, 2007, onSoyuz TMA-11.[28][29][30]Along with her Expedition 16 crew memberYuri Malenchenkoandspaceflight participantYi So-yeon, she returned to Earth inSoyuz TMA-11on April 19, 2008. The re-entry was remarkable for the failure of the Soyuz propulsion module to separate properly, and the subsequent "ballistic reentry" which subjected the crew to forces about eight times that of Earth surface gravity.[31]She spent 191 days, 19 hrs and 8 mins in space on this mission.[32]
On December 18, 2007, during the fourthspacewalkof Expedition 16 to inspect theS4starboardSolar Alpha Rotary Joint(SARJ), the ground team in Mission Control informed Whitson that she had become the female astronaut with the most cumulativeEVAtime inNASAhistory, as well as the most EVAs, with her fifth EVA. Three hours and 37 minutes into the spacewalk, Whitson surpassed NASA astronautSunita Williamswith a total time at that point of 29 hours and 18 minutes.[33][34]At the completion of Whitson's fifth EVA, the 100th in support of ISS assembly and maintenance, Whitson's cumulative EVA time became 32 hours, and 36 minutes, which placed her in 20th place fortotal EVA time.[34]Her sixth spacewalk, also during Expedition 16, brought her cumulative EVA time to 39 hours, 46 minutes, which ranked her 23rd fortotal EVA timeas of November 2009.

Expedition 50/51/52
Peggy Whitson arrived at the International Space Station on November 19, 2016,[35]onSoyuz MS-03, which was launched on November 17, 2016, from theBaikonur cosmodromein Kazakhstan.[36]She became the commander ofExpedition 51.[37][38]With the launch of Expedition 50/51 with her on it, Whitson, at age 56, became the oldest woman to fly into space.[23]During the mission, she broke the record for cumulative time spent in space by a U.S. astronaut, surpassing the previous record of 534 days set by Jeff Williams.[39]In early April 2017, her mission was extended by an additional 3 months at theInternational Space Station. On September 3, she returned in a previously vacant seat on theSoyuz capsuleaccompanied by NASA'sJack FischerandFyodor YurchikhinofRoscosmos.[40]
In January 2017, Whitson performed her seventh EVA with Expedition 50 commanderShane Kimbrough. During the EVA, three new adapter plates were installed and electrical connectors were hooked up preparing the way to replace the ISS's batteries. The EVA lasted 6 hours and 32 minutes. Whitson now holds the record for the oldest female spacewalker, and is now tied with the record for total spacewalks by a woman (seven), along withSunita Williams.[13]After completion of the seventh EVA, Whitson's cumulative EVA time became 46 hours, 18 minutes, which placed her in 13th place fortotal EVA time.
On April 24, 2017, Whitson officially broke the record for longest amount of time spent in space by any NASA astronaut.[41]As a result, she received a televised phone call from the Oval Office from US PresidentDonald Trump, the President's daughterIvanka, and fellow astronautKathleen Rubins.[41][42]When interviewed on that day she declared 'It is actually a huge honor to break a record like this, but it is an honor for me back to be representing all the folks at NASA'.[43]
On May 12, 2017, Whitson performed her ninth career EVA withJack Fischer. After a short delay due to leaking equipment, they replaced an avionics box on the starboard truss called an ExPRESS Logistics Carrier (ELC), a storage platform. The duration was 4 hours and 13 minutes, and it was the 200th EVA to be performed on the ISS.[44]
On May 23, 2017, Whitson performed her tenth career EVA with Fischer. They replaced a backup multiplexer-demultiplexer (MDM) unit that had failed on May 20, 2017. The duration was 2 hours and 46 minutes, making Whitson's cumulative EVA time more than 60 hours, placing her third on the list for most EVA time.[45]
On June 1, 2017, Whitson passed over the command of the International Space Station toFyodor Yurchikhin, who was named commander ofExpedition 52until he, Whitson andJack Fischerreturned to Earth aboardSoyuz MS-04in September 2017.[46][47]
Whitson returned to Earth on September 3, 2017 after she accrued a total of 665 days in space over the course of her career. This total was more time in space than any other woman worldwide and any other American.[4]As of April 2021, she is ranked ninth on the list of total time spent in space.[48]The duration of her stay in space during expeditions 50/51/52 was 289 days, 5 hours and 1 minute.[49]In June 2020, Whitson was a guest (along with two imposters) on an ABC-TVTo Tell the Truthepisode in which Patti LaBelle correctly selected her as the record-holding time in space astronaut.

Axiom 2
Axiom 2 lifted off on 21 May 2023 fromLaunch Complex 39AatKennedy Space Center, onboard aFalcon 9 Block 5rocket. The mission, which was the second flight ofCrew DragonFreedom, docked with the International Space Station a day later.
During the mission, the crew performed public outreach activities along with scientific research, including studies into the effects of microgravity on stem cells and other biological experiments.[50]
After eight days docked to the ISS, Axiom 2 undocked and returned to Earth twelve hours later.Freedomsplashed downsuccessfully in theGulf of Mexicooff the coast ofPanama City, Florida. It was recovered by SpaceX's recovery shipMegan.[51]

Axiom 4
In April 2024, she was confirmed as the commander of Axiom 4,[52]a 16-day mission to the ISS with a crew of four astronauts. The mission launched on 25 June 2025, which was the first flight ofCrew DragonGrace, docking with the International Space Station scheduled a day later.[53]
