Joseph Richard Tanner(born January 21, 1950) is an Americaninstructorat theUniversity of Colorado Boulder,[1]mechanical engineer, a formernaval officerandaviator, and a formerNASAastronaut.[2]He was born inDanville, Illinois. He is unusual among astronauts as he did not have a background in flight test nor did he earn any advanced academic degrees. Typically those who did not do military flight test have an M.D. or Ph.D., if not a master's, whereas Tanner's path to becoming an astronaut followed operational military flying and then into NASA for operational jet training before being selected into theNASA Astronaut Corpsin1992, following an unsuccessful application in1987.

Background
Tanner was born January 21, 1950, inDanville,Illinois. He is married with two children, sons William and Matthew. Tanner is anEagle Scoutfrom Troop #19 (Danville, IL) with theBoy Scouts of America.[3]Following graduation fromDanville High Schoolin 1968, he attended and graduated with aBachelor of Sciencedegree inmechanical engineeringfrom theUniversity of Illinois at Urbana-Champaignin 1973. His hobbies include:swimming,camping,mountaineering, spending time with his family.
He had an identical twin brother, David, who graduated from Indiana University,Phi Beta Kappa, with a double major inmathematicsandphysicsand also heldmaster's degreesincomputer scienceandexercise scienceand aPh.D.in human performance from the Department of Kinesiology atIndiana University.
Tanner's mother comes fromLlanddewi Brefi,Wales.[4]He is a cousin of the formerNational Poet of WalesGwyneth Lewis.[5]

Navy service
After he graduated from the University of Illinois in 1973 as an engineer, Tanner joined theU.S. Navy. He received hisNaval Aviator wingsin 1975, before serving as anA-7Epilot with Light Attack Squadron 94 (VFA-94) aboard theUSSCoral Sea. He finished his active service as an advanced jetinstructor pilotwith Training Squadron 4 (VT-4) inPensacola, Florida.[6]
He has accumulated almost 9,000 hours in military and NASA aircraft, and over 1,000 hours in space, including nearly 50 hours in spacewalks.[7]

NASA career
Hallelujah!
Tanner flew aboard theSpace ShuttleAtlantison theSTS-66, November 3–14, 1994, performing the Atmospheric Laboratory for Applications and Science-3 (ATLAS-3) mission. ATLAS-3 was the third in a series of flights to study theEarth's atmospherecomposition and solar effects at several points during theSun's 11-year cycle. The mission also carried the CRISTA-SPAS satellite that was deployed to study thechemical compositionof the middle atmosphere and retrieved later in the mission. Tanner logged 262 hours and 34 minutes inspaceand 175 orbits of theEarth.
Tanner performed two spacewalks as a member of theSTS-82crew to service theHubble Space Telescope(HST) in February, 1997. The STS-82 crew of seven launched aboard Space ShuttleDiscoveryon February 11 and returned to a night landing atKennedy Space Centeron February 21. During the flight the crew completed five spacewalks to improve the science capability of the telescope and replace aging support equipment, restoring HST to near perfect working condition. The crew boosted HST's orbit by 8 nautical miles (15 km) before releasing it to once again study theUniverse. Tanner's twospace walkstotaled 14 hours and 01 minutes. The flight orbited the Earth 150 times covering 4.1 million miles (6,600,000 km) in 9 days, 23 hours, 37 minutes.
Tanner's third mission wasSTS-97aboard Space ShuttleEndeavour(November 30 to December 11, 2000), the fifth Space Shuttle mission dedicated to the assembly of theInternational Space Station. While docked to the station, the crew installed the first set of U.S. solar arrays, in addition to delivering supplies and equipment to the station's first resident crew. Tanner performed three space walks totaling 19 hours 20 minutes. Mission duration was 10 days, 19 hours, 57 minutes, and covered 4.47 million miles (7,190,000 km).
Tanner's fourth mission,STS-115aboard Space ShuttleAtlantislaunched on September 9, 2006. On September 13, he participated in the 5 hour 26 min spacewalk to connect the P3/4 truss to the ISS. STS-115 returned to Earth on September 21, 2006. A photo that he took during his spacewalk was later listed onPopular Science's photo gallery of the bestastronaut selfies.[8]

Post-NASA career
Tanner joined the University of Colorado Boulder's Aerospace Engineering Science Department as a senior instructor in September 2008.  He assists with senior project course and master's project course.[1]He is also a self-employed aerospace systemsconsultant.
