Franklin Story Musgrave(born August 19, 1935) is an Americanphysicianand a retiredNASAastronaut. He is apublic speaker[2]and consultant to bothDisney'sImagineeringgroup and Applied Minds in California. In 1996, he became only the second astronaut to fly on six spaceflights, and he is the most formally educated astronaut with six academic degrees along with astronautLee Morin. Musgrave is the only astronaut to have flown aboard all fiveSpace Shuttles.

Early life
Musgrave was born August 19, 1935, the son of Percy Musgrave Jr. (1903–1973) and Marguerite Warton Musgrave (néeSwann; 1909–1982).[3]He grew up inStockbridge, Massachusetts, but considersLexington, Kentucky, to be his hometown.[4]
Musgrave has strongNew Englandancestral roots, descending fromMayflowerpassengersJohn HowlandandJohn Tilley, as well as earlyWatertown, Massachusetts, settlerRichard Saltonstall. Saltonstall's uncle wasRichard Saltonstall,Lord Mayor of London.
His 4th great-grandfather wasWilliam Gray, a lieutenant governor of Massachusetts from 1810 to 1812 and a Massachusetts State Representative and Senator. His first cousin, four times removed wasHorace Gray,Massachusetts Supreme Court Justicefrom 1864 to 1882 andUnited States Supreme Court Justicefrom 1882 to 1902.
His name comes from his 2nd great-grandfather, Franklin Howard Story Jr. (1825–1900) and 3rd great-grandfather, Franklin Howard Story (1795–1871). His 4th great-grandfather, Elisha Story (1743–1805), was a participant in theBoston Tea Partyin 1773. Another son of Elisha,Joseph Story(Musgrave's 4th great-uncle) was aUnited States Congressmanfrom Massachusetts and a United States Supreme Court Justice from 1812 to 1845. Joseph's son (Musgrave's 1st cousin, four times removed) was artist and sculptorWilliam Wetmore Story. William's son (Musgrave's second cousin, thrice removed) was painterJulian Russell Story.[5]
Musgrave attendedDexter SchoolinBrookline, Massachusetts, andSt. Mark's SchoolinSouthborough, Massachusetts, from 1947 to 1953. He dropped out of St. Mark's in his senior year when a car accident "caused him to miss a substantial amount of vital pre-graduation exam schooling."[6]

Career
After leaving high school, Musgrave enlisted in theUnited States Marine Corpsin 1953. He served as an aviation electrician, instrument technician and aircraft crew chief while completing duty assignments inKorea,JapanandHawaii, and aboard the carrierUSSWaspin theFar East. Musgrave's aviator brother Percy (1933–1959), who also served on USSWasp, died on a mission when the carrier "ran over him" after a takeoff crash.[7]
Although he did not qualify as a pilot until completing his stipulated astronaut training, Musgrave has flown 17,700 hours in 160 different types of civilian and military aircraft, including 7,500 hours injet aircraft.[4]He has earnedFAAratings forinstructor, instrument instructor,gliderinstructor, and airline transport pilot in addition toastronaut wings.[4]An accomplishedparachutist, he has made more than 800 free falls, including over 100 experimental free-fall descents involved with the study of human aerodynamics.[4]
While serving in the Marines, he completed hisGED.[8]Following his discharge, Musgrave received aBachelor of Sciencedegree inmathematicsandstatisticsfromSyracuse Universityin 1958.[9]Following his graduation from Syracuse University, Musgrave was briefly employed as a mathematician and operations analyst by theEastman Kodak CompanyinRochester, New Yorkin 1958.
Musgrave went on to receive aMaster of Business Administrationdegree inoperations analysisandcomputer programmingfrom theUniversity of California, Los Angelesin 1959, aBachelor of Artsdegree inchemistryfromMarietta Collegein 1960, and aDoctor of Medicinedegree fromColumbia University College of Physicians and Surgeonsin 1964.
Upon completing his medical degree, he served a surgical internship at theUniversity of KentuckyMedical Center from 1964 to 1965. He continued there as aUnited States Air Forcepostdoctoral fellow (1965–1966), working inaerospace medicineand physiology, and as aNational Heart Institutepostdoctoralfellow(1966–1967), teaching and researching cardiovascular andexercise physiology. In 1966, he earned aMaster of Sciencedegree inphysiologyandbiophysicsfrom theUniversity of Kentucky. From 1967 to 1989, he practiced clinical medicine on a part-time basis at Denver General Hospital (presently known asDenver Health Medical Center) and served as an adjunct instructor of physiology and biophysics at the University of Kentucky Medical Center. He earned aMaster of Artsdegree inliteraturefrom theUniversity of Houston–Clear Lakein 1987.[10]
He has written or been listed as a co-author of twenty-five scientific papers in the areas ofaerospace medicineand physiology,temperature regulation, exercise physiology, and clinical surgery.

NASA
Musgrave was selected as a scientist-astronaut by NASA in August 1967 as a member ofNASA Astronaut Group 6.[11]After completing flight and academic training, he worked on the design and development of theSkylabProgram. In 1973, he was the backup Science Pilot forSkylab 2, becoming the first Group 6 astronaut to receive a potential flight assignment.
Musgrave participated in the design and development of allSpace Shuttleextra-vehicular activity equipment, includingspacesuits,life supportsystems,airlocksandManned Maneuvering Units. From 1979 to 1982, and 1983 to 1984, he was assigned as a test and verification pilot in the Shuttle Avionics Integration Laboratory atJSC.
Musgrave served as aCAPCOMfor the second and third Skylab missions,STS-31,STS-35,STS-36,STS-38andSTS-41. He was amission specialistonSTS-6(1983),STS-51-F/Spacelab-2 (1985),STS-33(1989),STS-44(1991), andSTS-80(1996); and the payload commander onSTS-61(1993).
A veteran of six space flights, Musgrave has spent a total of 1,281 hours, 59 minutes, 22 seconds on space missions, including nearly 27 hours ofEVA.
Musgrave is the only astronaut to have flown on all fiveSpace Shuttles. Prior toJohn Glenn's return to space in 1998, Musgrave held the record for the oldest person in orbit at age 61.[12]
He retired fromNASAin 1997, after 30 years as an astronaut.[13]

Spaceflight experience

STS-6
He first flew onSTS-6, which launched from theKennedy Space Center, on April 4, 1983, and landed atEdwards Air Force BaseinCalifornia, on April 9, 1983. During this maiden voyage ofSpace ShuttleChallenger, the crew performed the first Shuttle deployment of an IUS/TDRS satellite, and Musgrave andDon Petersonconducted the first Space Shuttleextra-vehicular activity(EVA) to test the new space suits and construction and repair devices and procedures. On this mission Musgrave became the first astronaut to do a spacewalk from a Space Shuttle. Mission duration was 5 days, 23 minutes, 42 seconds.

STS-51-F
OnSTS-51-F/Spacelab-2, the crew aboardChallengerlaunched from the Kennedy Space Center, Florida, on July 29, 1985, and landed at Edwards Air Force Base, California, on August 6, 1985. This flight was the first pallet-only Spacelab mission, and the first mission to operate the Spacelab Instrument Pointing System (IPS). It carried 13 major experiments inastronomy,astrophysics, andlife sciences. During this mission, Musgrave served as thesystems engineerduring launch and entry, and as a pilot during the orbital operations. Mission duration was 7 days, 22 hours, 45 minutes, 26 seconds.

STS-33
OnSTS-33, he served aboard theSpace ShuttleDiscovery, which launched at night from the Kennedy Space Center, Florida, on November 22, 1989. This classified mission operated payloads for theUnited States Department of Defense. Following 79 orbits, the mission concluded on November 27, 1989, with a landing at sunset on Runway 04 at Edwards Air Force Base, California. Mission duration was 5 days, 7 minutes, 32 seconds.

STS-44
STS-44also launched at night on November 24, 1991. The primary mission objective was accomplished with the successful deployment of aDefense Support Program(DSP) satellite with an Inertial Upper Stage (IUS) rocket booster. In addition, the crew also conducted twoMilitary Man in SpaceExperiments, three radiation monitoring experiments, and numerous medical tests to support longer duration Shuttle flights. The mission was concluded in 110 orbits of theEarthwithAtlantisreturning to a landing on the lakebed at Edwards Air Force Base, California, on December 1, 1991. Mission duration was 6 days, 22 hours, 50 minutes, 42 seconds.

STS-61
STS-61was the firstHubble Space Telescope(HST) servicing and repair mission.  Following a night launch from Kennedy Space Center on December 2, 1993,Endeavourrendezvoused with and captured the HST. During this 11-day flight, the HST was restored to its full capabilities through the work of two pairs of astronauts during a record 5 spacewalks. Musgrave performed 3 of these spacewalks, becoming the first astronaut-physician to do a spacewalk on two space missions. After having travelled 4,433,772 miles in 163 orbits of the Earth,Endeavourreturned to a night landing inFloridaon December 13, 1993. Mission duration was 10 days, 19 hours, 59 minutes.

STS-80
OnSTS-80, (November 19 to December 7, 1996), the crew aboardSpace ShuttleColumbiadeployed and retrieved theWake Shield Facility(WSF) and theOrbiting Retrievable Far and Extreme Ultraviolet Spectrometer(ORFEUS)satellites. The free-flying WSF created a super vacuum in its wake in which to growthin film wafersfor use in semiconductors and the electronics industry. The ORFEUS instruments, mounted on the reusableShuttle Pallet Satellite, studied the origin and makeup of stars.
During deorbit and landing, Musgrave stood in the cockpit and pointed a handheld video camera out the windows. In doing so, he recorded the plasma streams over the orbiter's hull for the first time, and he is still the only astronaut to see them first-hand. In completing this mission he logged a record 278 Earth orbits and traveled over 7 million miles in 17 days, 15 hours, 53 minutes.

Media appearances and space snakes
Musgrave has madecameo appearanceson several documentary TV programs, as well as the movieMission to Mars(2000) as "3rdCAPCOM" and the TV showHome Improvement(Series 3, Episode 24, "Reality Bytes"). In 2012, he appeared at Chicon 7, the70th World Science Fiction Convention, as the "Astronaut Guest of Honor."[14]
On two of my missions, and I still don't have an answer, um, I have seen a, a snake out there, six seven eight feet long. It is rubbery because it has internal waves in it and it follows you for a rather long period of time.
In 1995 while being interviewed for a space documentary,Sightings, Musgrave irked NASA officials and surprised his colleagues when he declared that during two of his missions he saw "snakes" floating around in space - a fact that he failed to officially report to NASA upon his return.[16]
All kinds of debris come off space ships, especially at the back end after the main engines shut down and you open the doors: ice chips, oxygen or hydrogen, stuff dumped from the engines. On two flights I've seen and photographed what I call "the snake," like a seven-foot eel swimming out there. It may be an uncritical rubber seal from the main engines. In zero g it's totally free to maneuver, and it has its own internal waves like it's swimming.
In an interview withOmni, Musgrave mentioned seeing what he calls "the snake" on two flights and speculated it to be a rubber seal.[18]
