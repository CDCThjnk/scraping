Paul Desmond Scully-Power,AMGOSEFRAeS(born May 28, 1944) is an Australian-born Americanoceanographer, technology expert, business executive and astronaut. In 1984, while a civilian employee of the United StatesNaval Undersea Warfare Center, he flew aboardNASASpace Shuttle missionSTS-41-Gas aPayload Specialist. He was the first Australian-born person to journey into space,[1]and the first astronaut with a beard.[2]
During his time in space he was able to confirm the existence ofspiral eddies, and observe them with the naked eye.[3][4]
Scully-Power went on to work in private industry. He is considered a world expert inremote sensing: visible, infra-red, radar and acoustic[5]and is considered a security, aviation and aerospace expert.[6]
He was appointed aMember of the Order of Australia(AM) in the2004 Australia Day Honours"for service to science in the fields of oceanography and space remote sensing, and to the community through contributions to a range of government regulatory agencies and through raising public awareness of conservation issues."[7]

Early life and education
Paul Scully-Power was born inSydney, Australia. He attended schools inLondon, andSaint Ignatius' College, Riverviewand St Pius X College, Chatswood, inSydney. He studied applied mathematics at theUniversity of Sydney, where he resided atSt John's College, and graduated with aBachelor of Sciencewith Honours in 1966 and aDiploma of Educationin 1967.

Career
In January 1967, after graduating from the University of Sydney, Scully-Power was approached by theRoyal Australian Navyto set up the first oceanographic group within the Navy.
From January 1967 to July 1972 he was a Scientific officer, and remained the first permanent head of the oceanographic group.
From July 1972 to March 1974 he was an Australian Navy Exchange Scientist,U.S. Navy. He also worked at the U.S. Naval Underwater Systems Center,New London, Connecticut, and at theOffice of Naval Research,Washington, D.C.During this period, he was invited to assist the Earth Observations team on theSkylabProject and has worked in space oceanography for each crewed spacecraft mission since that time.
From March 1974 to March 1975 he returned to Australia, planned and executed the joint Australia, New Zealand, United States projectANZUS EDDY, which was the first combined oceanographic and acoustic measurement of an ocean eddy ever conducted.
In 1976, he was appointed a foreign principal investigator for the Heat Capacity Mapping Mission, which was one of a series of satellites launched by NASA to explore the usefulness of remote sensing measurements.
In October 1977, he emigrated to the United States and was offered a position at the Naval Underwater Systems Center. This position is that of a senior scientist and technical specialist on the staff of the Associate Technical Director for Research and Technology with the responsibility to insure the development of a comprehensive and balanced technology base within the Center. He became a U.S. citizen in 1982.

NASA career
In June 1984, Scully-Power was chosen by NASA to be aPayload Specialist(known among the crew affectionately as a blanket counter) on the 13th Shuttle mission, which would study Earth Sciences. His space flightSTS-41-GChallenger(October 5–13, 1984) was launched from and returned to land at theKennedy Space Center,Florida. STS-41-G was the first mission with a 7-person crew, and the first to demonstrate American orbital fuel transfer. During the 8-day flight, the crew deployed the Earth Radiation Budget Satellite, conducted scientific observations of the earth with the OSTA-3 pallet and Large Format Camera, and demonstrated potential satellite refueling with an EVA and associated hydrazine transfer. At mission conclusion, Scully-Power had traveled over 3.4 million miles in 133 Earth orbits, and logged over 197 hours in space.
His role was to investigate spiral eddies, which at the time were thought to be rare. He was able to photograph them with an ordinary camera, and show that they were ubiquitous.[8]
NASA initially expected him to shave his beard before spaceflight, but allowed it after he was able to demonstrate that it did not affect his helmet's seal.[9]

Corporate career
Scully-Power became the CTO ofTenix Groupin 2004,[6]Australia's largest Defence & Technology contractor.[10]In 2007 was appointed chairman and CEO of SensorConnect Inc., aSilicon Valleyhigh-tech company.
Scully-Power has extensive commercial, government and academic experience in Australia, New Zealand, the United Kingdom, and the United States, and is widely recognised in the fields of defence & national security, aviation & aerospace, marine science, communications & systems analysis, and education.[10]
Scully-Power has served as a director of a number of public and private corporate and advisory boards worldwide.
Scully-Power is past chairman of the AustralianCivil Aviation Safety Authority[11]and the Federal Government's International Space Advisory Group, a former Chancellor ofBond University(Australia's largest private university), and was the inaugural Chairman of the Queensland Premier's Science and Technology Council. Prior to that he spent over twenty years in the United States where he managed and led many high technology and defence industry programs. He served with the U.S. Navy, NASA,the Pentagon, and theWhite House, where he was the head of a Government-Industry partnership for the development of advanced communications systems as part of the White House National Technology Strategy Program. He was also responsible for the funding of major programs at universities and research institutions on behalf of the U.S. government. Additionally, he held the Distinguished Chair of Environmental Acoustics, was a research associate at theScripps Institution of Oceanography, chairman of Membership of theConnecticut Academy of Science and Engineering, served on the University & College Accreditation Board, and was president of the Fort Trumbull Federal Credit Union. Before going to America, he was the inaugural head of the Royal Australian Navy's Oceanographic Group, deploying to sea on 26 cruises and qualifying as a naval ship's diver.[12]
Scully-Power was the first president of the U.N. International Commission on Space Oceanography. He isU.S. Air Forcequalified for full pressure suit flying, and was a flight crew instructor in theAstronaut Office,Johnson Space Center,Houston, Texas. Scully-Power is a Fellow of theRoyal Aeronautical Society, aLiverymanof theGuild of Air Pilots and Air Navigators, and aFreemanof theCity of London.[12]
He is involved in many business and community groups through his roles as patron of the Australian Aviation Museum, the Royal Australian Navy Laboratory Association, and the League of Ancient Mariners; past vice president of the Naval Warfare Officers' Association; a member of the International Trade and Government Committee of theU.S. Chamber of Commerce; and a director of the Australia Youth Trust set up by Princess Diana. He is also a founding member of the advisory board of Environment Business Australia.
