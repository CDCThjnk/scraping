He worked summers as a park ranger in the 80,000 acre federal wilderness that borders Eminence.[2]He graduated from theUniversity of Missouri-Rolla(now theMissouri University of Science and Technology) withB.S.andM.S.degrees inapplied mathematicsin 1973 and 1975, respectively.[1]At the age of 24, he returned to Eminence to become its math teacher, and subsequently its high school principal.[3]In 1979, when aUnited States Air Forcerecruiter left brochures on his desk for his students, it was Akers who decided to sign up.

As part of his training with NASA, Akers taught science classes atTroy State Universityfor a brief period of time.[2]

NASA career
Akers is a veteran of four shuttle flights in which he spent over 800 hours in orbit, including more than 29 hours ofextra-vehicular activity(EVA) experience. In each of his flights, his role was as amission specialist.

His first space flight was in 1990 onSTS-41,[5]the 11th flight ofSpace ShuttleDiscovery.[6]He was instrumental in deploying theEuropean Space AgencysatelliteUlysses,[3]a solar-exploration craft, as well as tending several secondary payloads and experiments.[7]

STS-49
His next mission was in 1992 onSTS-49, the maiden flight of ShuttleEndeavour.[8]A primary goal of that mission was to capture and repair the non-functionalIntelsatVI-F3satellite. The first two attempts failed; Akers joined the third attempt which was successful.[9]This marks the first three-person EVA in human history[10]and was also the longest EVA (8 hours, 29 minutes) ever conducted to that time.[11]

STS-61
On Akers' third mission in 1993 onSTS-61,[2]the fifth flight ofEndeavour, he was one of four mission specialists who repaired and upgraded theHubble Space Telescopeon its first servicing mission.[12]Akers spent just under 13.5 hours outside theEndeavourin two EVAs.[13]
On May 18, 1994, Akers appeared onHome Improvementas himself along with rest of the STS-61 crew.[14]

Akers retired fromNASAin 1997 and the Air Force in 1999 at the rank ofcolonel, taking a position as instructor of Mathematics at theUniversity of Missouri–Rolla,[1]which in 2008 changed its name to the Missouri University of Science and Technology. Akers retired from teaching in 2010.[17]

Other work
Akers made acameo appearanceon the TV showHome ImprovementbyTouchstone Television. In Series 3, Episode 24, "Reality Bytes", Akers and the Hubble crew appeared as guests on Tool Time and showed some of the tools they used in space.
