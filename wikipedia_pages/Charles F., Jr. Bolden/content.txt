In 2020, Bolden was elected a member of theNational Academy of Engineeringfor leadership and development of U.S. human spaceflight and space operations programs, and for revitalizing fundamental aeronautics research.

Education
Bolden graduated from C. A. Johnson High School inColumbia, South Carolina, in 1964.[6]He earned aBachelor of Sciencedegree in Electrical Science from theUnited States Naval Academyin 1968, where he was a contemporary of future Marine officersOliver North,Jim WebbandMichael Hageeand futureChairman of the Joint Chiefs of StaffMichael Mullen, and AdmiralsDennis C. Blair, andJay L. Johnson, and later earned aMaster of Sciencedegree inSystems Managementfrom theUniversity of Southern Californiain 1977. He is a member ofOmega Psi Phifraternity.

Military career
In high school Bolden was turned down for an appointment to theUnited States Naval Academyby South Carolina's Congressional delegation, which included thensegregationistSenatorStrom Thurmond. Bolden received his appointment after personally writing, as a high school senior, to PresidentLyndon B. Johnson. A recruiter came to his house a few weeks later, eventually leading to Bolden receiving an appointment from U.S. RepresentativeWilliam L. DawsonfromChicago, Illinois. He later received notes of congratulations from Thurmond at various career milestones.[6]
Bolden was commissioned asecond lieutenantin theUnited States Marine Corps(USMC) following graduation from theUnited States Naval Academyin 1968. He was president of his class. He underwent flight training atPensacola, Florida,Meridian, Mississippi, andKingsville, Texas, before being designated aUnited States Naval Aviatorin May 1970.
He flew more than 100 sorties intoNorthandSouth Vietnam,Laos, andCambodiain theA-6A Intruderwhile assigned toVMA(AW)-533atRoyal Thai Air Base Nam Phong,Thailand, from June 1972 to June 1973.[7]Upon returning to the United States, Bolden began a two-year tour as a Marine Corps officer selection andrecruitingofficer inLos Angeles, California, followed by three years in various assignments atMarine Corps Air Station El Toro, California.
In June 1979, he graduated from theUnited States Naval Test Pilot SchoolatNaval Air Station Patuxent River, Marylandand was assigned to theNaval Air Test Center's Systems Engineering and Strike Aircraft Test Directorates. While there, he served as an ordnance test pilot and flew numerous test projects in theA-6E,EA-6B, andA-7C/Eairplanes. He logged more than 6,000 hours flying time.
Bolden was selected as an astronaut candidate by NASA in 1980. He was a member of theNASA Astronaut Corpsuntil 1994 when he returned to assignments in the Marine Corps, first as the Deputy Commandant of Midshipmen at the Naval Academy, effective June 27, 1994. In July 1997, he was assigned as the Deputy Commanding General ofI Marine Expeditionary Force.

He then served as the Commanding General,3rd Marine Aircraft Wing, from August 9, 2000, until August 2002. He retired from the military in August 2004.

NASA career
Selected by NASA in May 1980, Boldenbecame an astronautin August 1981. He was one of several astronauts recruited by Nichelle Nichols as part of a NASA effort to increase the number of minority and female astronauts.[8]His technical assignments included: Astronaut Office Safety Officer; Technical Assistant to the Director of Flight Crew Operations; Special Assistant to the Director of theJohnson Space Center; Astronaut Office Liaison to the Safety, Reliability and Quality Assurance Directorates of theMarshall Space Flight Center(MSFC) and theKennedy Space Center(KSC); Chief of the Safety Division at JSC; Lead Astronaut for Vehicle Test and Checkout at the Kennedy Space Center; and Assistant Deputy Administrator, NASA Headquarters.[9]
A veteran of four space flights, he has logged over 680 hours in space. Bolden served as pilot onSTS-61-C(January 12–18, 1986) andSTS-31(April 24–29, 1990), and was the mission commander onSTS-45(March 24 – April 2, 1992), andSTS-60(February 3–11, 1994).
Bolden was the first person to ride theLaunch Complex 39 slidewire basketswhich enable rapid escape from aSpace Shuttleon the launch pad. The need for a human test was determined following a launch abort onSTS-41-Dwhere controllers were afraid to order the crew to use the untested escape system.[10]
A few years before his appointment by President Barack Obama to be administrator of NASA, Bolden auditioned, along with professional actors, for the role of virtual host for NASA's "Shuttle Launch Experience" educational attraction at theKennedy Space Center Visitor ComplexinMerritt Island, Florida.[11]

Spaceflights
OnSTS-61-C, Bolden pilotedSpace ShuttleColumbia. During the six-day flight, crew members deployed theSATCOMKu-bandsatellite and conducted experiments in astrophysics and materials processing. The mission launched from Kennedy Space Center on January 12, 1986, orbited the Earth 96 times, and ended with a successful night landing atEdwards Air Force Base, California on January 18, 1986. Coincidently, SenatorBill Nelson, who like Bolden would also go on to serve as a NASA Administrator, also flew on STS-61-C as apayload specialist. STS-61-C was the final mission before theSpace ShuttleChallengerdisaster.
Bolden pilotedSpace ShuttleDiscoveryduringSTS-31. Launched on April 24, 1990, from Kennedy Space Center, the crew spent the five-day mission deploying theHubble Space Telescopeand conducting a variety of mid-deck experiments. They also used a variety of cameras, including both theIMAXin cabin and cargo bay cameras, for Earth observations from their record-setting altitude of over 400 miles. Following 75 orbits of Earth in 121 hours,Discoverylanded at Edwards Air Force Base on April 29, 1990.
OnSTS-45, Bolden commanded a crew of seven aboardSpace ShuttleAtlantis, launched on March 24, 1992, from Kennedy Space Center. STS-45 was the firstSpacelabmission dedicated to NASA's "Mission to Planet Earth". During the nine-day mission, the crew operated the twelve experiments that constituted the ATLAS-1 (Atmospheric Laboratory for Applications and Science) cargo. ATLAS-1 obtained detailed measurements of atmospheric chemical and physical properties. In addition, this was the first time an artificial beam of electrons was used to stimulate an auroral discharge. Following 143 orbits of Earth,Atlantislanded at Kennedy Space Center on April 2, 1992.
Bolden commandedSTS-60's crew of six aboardDiscovery. This was the historic first joint-American–Russian Space Shuttle mission involving the participation of a Russian cosmonaut,Sergei Krikalev, as amission specialist. The flight launched on February 3, 1994, from Kennedy Space Center, and carried the Space Habitation Module-2 (SPACEHAB-2), and theWake Shield Facility. The crew conducted a series of joint American/Russian science activities. The mission achieved 130 orbits of the Earth, ending with a landing on February 11, 1994, at the Kennedy Space Center.[7]

Administrator of NASA
In 2009, President Obama appointed Bolden to be administrator of NASA.[12]
In a NASA video published April 28, 2010, titled "NASA's New Era of Innovation and Discovery", Bolden said, "We're going to turn science fiction into science fact".[13][14]
On the same day, at a question and answer session with employees at the Johnson Space Center, Bolden compared theConstellation Programto astillbornbaby calf extracted from acamel's womb byU.S. Marines. Bolden said, "We've got some stillborn calves around, and we have got to figure out ways to help each other bring them back to life".[15]
In a June 2010 interview withAl Jazeera, Bolden said that the top three goals he was tasked with by President Obama were to help re-inspire children to want to get into science and math, to expand NASA's international relationships, and, "perhaps foremost", "to reach out to the Muslim world ... to help them feel good about their historic contribution to science... and math and engineering".[16][17]The White House disagreed with Bolden's statement, with the press secretary saying Bolden probably misspoke and "That was not his task, and that's not the task of NASA".[18]
Bolden said his agency's long-term ambition is landing astronauts onMars.[19]He has cited spending cuts as a concern for major NASA projects.[20]
On August 28, 2012, he was the first human being to have his voice broadcast on the surface of Mars. Although the rover has no speakers, it received the transmission of his voice and then beamed it back to Earth.[21][22]
In 2013, he noted theNational Aerospace WeekasAdministrator of NASA.[23]
On October 28, 2015, Bolden presented the next steps for ahuman journey to Marsat theCenter for American ProgressinWashington, D.C.[24][25][26][27]
On January 12, 2017, Bolden announced his resignation from NASA during a Town Hall meeting at NASA Headquarters in Washington D.C. His last day would be January 19, andRobert M. Lightfoot Jr.was announced as acting NASA Administrator.
After leaving NASA, Bolden has served on theUnited Arab EmiratesSpace Advisory Committee.[28]

Personal life
Bolden lives inAlexandria, Virginia, and is married to Alexis (née Walker); the couple have two children.[29]Bolden is aChristian, stating in a question and answer session in May 2010:
You know, the universe is a big place. I'm a practicing Christian, so in my faith, I learn about omnipotent, omnipresent God, which means he's everywhere. He's all-knowing. He does everything. And I just cannot bring my little pea brain to believe that a God like that would pick one planet of one of millions of suns and say that's the only place in the vast universe that I'm going to put any kind of life. And so the problem is I haven't been far enough away.[30]
In the2024 United States presidential election, Bolden endorsedKamala Harris.[31]
