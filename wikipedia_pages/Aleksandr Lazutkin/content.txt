Aleksandr Ivanovich Lazutkin(Russian:Александр Иванович Лазуткин; born October 30, 1957)[1]is a former Russiancosmonaut.

Life and career

Lazutkin has stated that Russian cosmonauts were givencognacfor extended missions in space.[2]

1997 Progress supply mission
Lazutkin was aboard theMir Space Stationwhen a collision occurred with the uncrewedProgressM34, its supply craft, which was piloted byVasily Tsibliyevwhile on the Mir.[3][4]The collision, considered the worst in the history of the space age,[4]knocked outSpektr's solar panels and caused the Mir to lose alignment with the sun, resulting in a loss of power.[4]It also caused the cabin to decompress.[5]
Quick action by the three crew members managed to avert immediate disaster.[4]Lazutkin and fellow crew memberMichael Foalequickly severed the connecting cables with the module and sealed off the hatches to the module, saving the rest of the station.[6]Lazutkin successfully cut some of the wires connecting the Mir and the Spektr using a small dinner knife.[3]A few days after the collision, Tsibliyev and Lazutkin were ordered to attempt to repair the Mir, while Foale was ordered to theSoyuz-TMescape pod.[3]The station was eventually secured safely.[4]
