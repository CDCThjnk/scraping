At the same time, he was involved in applying new imaging technology for industrial applications in deep water engineering projects and biological research. Reilly spent approximately 22 days in deep submergence vehicles operated byHarbor Branch Oceanographic Institutionand theU.S. Navy.[6]
NASA selected Reilly for the astronaut program in December 1994. He reported to theJohnson Space Centerin March 1995 and completed a year of training and evaluation, and qualified for flight assignment as a mission specialist.

Criticism
After James Reilly was appointed by President Trump to lead the U.S. Geological Survey he then instructed his office to abandon the traditional practice of using climate models that stretch to the end of the century and instead to only use climate models projecting the impact of climate change through 2040.[11][12]
His statements on theNational Climate Assessmentfocused on scientific uncertainties rather than directly stating concurrence with opinions expressed by some scientists.[13]
