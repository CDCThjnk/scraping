- Reilly was born at Mountain Home Air Force Base , Idaho , on March 18, 1954, though considers his hometown to be Mesquite, Texas . He graduated from Lake Highlands High School in Dallas, Texas in 1972. He has received three degrees in geosciences from the University of Texas at Dallas : a Bachelor of Science in 1977, a Master of Science 1987, and a Doctor of Philosophy in 1995.
- During graduate school , Reilly was selected to participate in the 1977–1978 scientific expedition to Marie Byrd Land , West Antarctica , as a research scientist specializing in stable isotope geochronology . In 1979, he started work as an exploration geologist with Santa Fe Minerals , in Dallas. From 1980 to the time he was selected for the astronaut program, Reilly was employed as an oil and gas exploration geologist for Enserch Exploration , in Dallas, rising to the position of Chief Geologist of the Offshore Region. At the same time, he was involved in applying new imaging technology for industrial applications in deep water engineering projects and biological research. Reilly spent approximately 22 days in deep submergence vehicles operated by Harbor Branch Oceanographic Institution and the U.S. Navy .
- NASA selected Reilly for the astronaut program in December 1994. He reported to the Johnson Space Center in March 1995 and completed a year of training and evaluation, and qualified for flight assignment as a mission specialist. Initially, he was assigned to work technical issues for the Astronaut Office Computer Support Branch. Reilly flew on STS-89 in 1998 and STS-104 in 2001. He has logged over 517 hours in space, including three spacewalks totaling 16 hours and 30 minutes. He has worked both on the ISS and Mir space stations.

- After James Reilly was appointed by President Trump to lead the U.S. Geological Survey he then instructed his office to abandon the traditional practice of using climate models that stretch to the end of the century and instead to only use climate models projecting the impact of climate change through 2040.
- His statements on the National Climate Assessment focused on scientific uncertainties rather than directly stating concurrence with opinions expressed by some scientists.
