Following test pilot training in 1974, he was project officer and test pilot for theA-7andA-4aircraft at the Strike Aircraft Test Directorate.  He served as a flight instructor at the U.S. Naval Test Pilot School from April 1976 until May 1977. He then attended the U.S.Naval Postgraduate SchoolatMonterey, California, from June 1977 until his selection for the astronaut candidate program.[2]
He has logged over 5,000 hours flying time in 28 different types of aircraft, and 400 carrier landings.

Space Shuttle astronaut
Selected as an astronaut candidate in 1978, Coats became a NASA astronaut in August 1979. He was a member of theSTS-4astronaut support crew, and was a capsule communicator (CAPCOM) forSTS-4andSTS-5.  A veteran of threespace flights, Coats flew onSTS-41-Din 1984,STS-29in 1989, andSTS-39in 1991. From May 1989 to March 1990, he served as ActingChief of the Astronaut Office.
On his first mission, Coats was pilot on the crew ofSTS-41-D, which launched fromKennedy Space Center,Florida, on August 30, 1984. This was the maiden flight of the OrbiterDiscovery. The mission was delayed three times over a two-month period prior to liftoff. Delays included the first pad abort of the Shuttle program (and the first for NASA sinceGemini 6A) as well as a fire on the launch pad.[3]During this 6-day mission the crew successfully activated the OAST-1 solar cell wing experiment, deployed three satellites (SBS-D, SYNCOM IV-2, and TELSTAR 3-C), operated the CFES-III experiment, the student crystal growth experiment, andphotographyexperiments using theIMAXmotion picture camera.  The crew earned the name "Icebusters" in successfully removing hazardous ice particles from the orbiter using theRemote Manipulator System.[4]STS-41-D completed 96 orbits of the Earth before landing atEdwards Air Force Base, California, on September 5, 1984.
In February 1985, Coats was selected as the commander ofSTS-61-H, which was subsequently canceled after theChallengeraccident.
As commander ofSTS-29, Coats and his crew launched fromKennedy Space CenteraboardDiscoveryon March 13, 1989. During this highly successful five-day mission, the crew deployed aTracking and Data Relay Satellite(TDRS), and performed numerous secondary experiments, including a Space Station "heat pipe" radiator experiment, two student experiments, a protein crystal growth experiment, and achromosomeand plant cell division experiment. In addition, the crew took over 3,000 photographs of the earth
using several types of cameras, including theIMAX70 mm movie camera. Mission duration was 80 orbits and concluded with a landing at Edwards Air Force Base, California, on March 18, 1989. With the completion of his second mission, Coats has logged a total of 264 hours in space.
Coats commanded a seven-man crew onSTS-39, an unclassified eight-dayDepartment of Defensemission launched from the Kennedy Space Center, Florida on April 28, 1991. Crew members worked around the clock in two-shift operations during which they deployed, operated and retrieved theSPAS-IIspacecraft, in addition to conducting various science experiments including research of both natural and induced phenomena in the Earth's atmosphere. After completing 134 orbits of the Earth,Discoveryand her crew landed at the Kennedy Space Center, Florida on May 6, 1991. With the completion of his third mission, Coats has logged over 463 hours in space.

Private sector
Coats left the astronaut corps and retired from the US Navy in 1991 to work forLoral Space Information Systems[5]From 1991 to 1996, Coats served as Vice President of Avionics and Communications Operations for Loral Space Information Systems, from 1996 to 1998 he was Vice President of Civil Space Programs for Lockheed Martin Missiles and Space inSunnyvale, California, and from 1998 to 2005 he was Vice President of Advanced Space Transportation for Lockheed Martin Space Systems Company inDenver, Colorado.[6]
