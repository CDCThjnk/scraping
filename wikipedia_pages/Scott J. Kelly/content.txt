Scott Joseph Kelly(born February 21, 1964) is an American engineer, retiredastronaut, andnaval aviator. A veteran of four space flights, Kelly commanded theInternational Space Station(ISS) on Expeditions26,45, and46.
Kelly's first spaceflight was aspilotofSpace ShuttleDiscoveryduringSTS-103in December 1999. This was the third servicing mission to theHubble Space Telescope, and lasted for just under eight days.[3]Kelly's second spaceflight was as mission commander ofSTS-118, a 12-day Space Shuttle mission to the ISS in August 2007.[4]Kelly's third spaceflight was as a crewmember onExpedition 25/26 on the ISS. He arrived at the ISS aboardSoyuz TMA-01Mon October 9, 2010, and served as a flight engineer until he took over command of the station on November 25, 2010, at the start ofExpedition 26.[5][6][7]Expedition 26 ended on March 16, 2011, with the departure ofSoyuz TMA-01M.[8]
In November 2012, Kelly and Russian cosmonautMikhail Kornienkowere selected for ayear-long missionto the ISS.[9][10]Their year in space began with the launch ofSoyuz TMA-16Mon March 27, 2015, and they remained on the station for Expeditions43,44, 45, and 46. The mission ended on March 1, 2016, with the departure ofSoyuz TMA-18Mfrom the station.[11][12]
Kelly retired from NASA on April 1, 2016.[13]Hisidentical twinbrother,Mark Kelly, is also a retired astronaut, and the seniorU.S. senatorfromArizona.[14][15]

Early life and education
Scott Kelly was born, along with his identical twin brotherMark, on February 21, 1964, inOrange, New Jersey, to Patricia (McAvoy) and Richard Kelly.[16]Kelly's family lived inWest Orange, where his parents worked as police officers.[17]Kelly and his brother graduated from West Orange Mountain High School (New Jersey) in 1982. While in high school, Kelly worked as anemergency medical technicianin Orange andJersey City, New Jersey.[18]: 32–41[11]
After graduating from high school, Kelly enrolled at theUniversity of Maryland, Baltimore County. During his first year, Kelly readThe Right StuffbyTom Wolfe, and was inspired to pursue a career innaval aviation.[18]: 40–41After his first year, Kelly transferred toState University of New York Maritime College, where he received aNaval Reserve Officers Training Corps(Navy ROTC) scholarship. During the summer after his first year, Kelly sailed aboard SUNY Maritime's training ship,Empire State V, and stopped inMallorca, Hamburg, and London. After his second year, Kelly sailed again onEmpire State V.[18]: 55–66He served as the student battalion commander for his school's Navy ROTC detachment, and graduated with a Bachelor of Engineering degree inelectrical engineeringin 1987.[18]: 107–110Kelly later earned a Master of Science degree in aviations systems from theUniversity of Tennessee.[19]

Naval career
After graduation, Kelly was commissioned as anensignin theUnited States Navy. He completed his initial flight school atNAS Pensacola, where he flew theT-34 Mentorpropeller driven trainer plane, after which he was selected to fly jets.[18]: 110–120In 1988, he moved toBeeville, Texas, for jet trainingNaval Air Station Chase Field, where he trained on theT-2 Buckeyeand theA-4 Skyhawk. He graduated as anaval aviatorin 1989, and was assigned to fly theF-14 Tomcat.[18]: 152–157He reported toVF-101atNaval Air Station Oceana,Virginia, for initial F-14 training. Upon completion of this training in September 1990, he was assigned toVF-143, and deployed to the North Atlantic andPersian Gulfaboard the aircraft carrierUSSDwight D. Eisenhower.[18]: 157–164
In January 1993, Kelly was selected to attend theU.S. Naval Test Pilot SchoolatNaval Air Station Patuxent River,Maryland. His classmates included his brother, Mark, and other future astronautsAlvin Drew,Lisa Nowak, andStephen Frick. He graduated in June 1994 and was assigned to the Strike Aircraft Test Directorate at Patuxent River. One of his initial assignments was to investigate the F-14 crash that killedKara Hultgreen. His assessment was to create a digital flight control system that would have saved Hultgreen's life. This resulted in the acceleration of one's development, and he was the first pilot to fly the F-14 with the digital flight control system installed.[18]: 166–170
After attaining the rank ofcaptainin the U.S. Navy, Kelly retired from active duty on June 19, 2012, after 25 years of naval service. He flew over 8,000 hours in more than 40 aircraft and accomplished over 250 carrier landings throughout his naval career.[11]

NASA career
In 1995, Kelly and his brother applied toNASAto become astronauts. He and Mark were selected to become astronaut candidates in April 1996; the first relatives to be selected in NASA history. In July 1996, Kelly moved to Houston, and began training inAstronaut Group 16at theJohnson Space Center. On completion of training, he was assigned to work on the caution and warning system on board the International Space Station.[18]: 195–196, 204–207, 211
After Kelly's first flight onSTS-103, he served as NASA's director of operations inStar City, Russia.[18]: 237–238He served as back-up crew member to Peggy Whitson for ISSExpedition 5, and toTracy Caldwell DysononExpedition 23/24.[18]: 242–244, 290[20]After theSpace ShuttleColumbiadisaster, Kelly coordinated airplane and helicopter searches for debris.[18]: 251–253He also served as the Astronaut Office Space Station Branch Chief.[11]
In September 2002, Kelly served as the commander of theNEEMO 4mission aboard theAquariusunderwater laboratory, 4 mi offshore fromKey Largo. The NEEMO 4 crew spent five dayssaturation divingfromAquariusas aspace analogfor working and training under extreme environmental conditions. The mission was delayed due toHurricane Isidore, reducing the underwater duration to five days.[21]In April 2005, Kelly was a crew member on the three-dayNEEMO 8mission. During the NEEMO 8 mission, the crew practiced construction while conducting anextravehicular activity(EVA) using aremotely operated underwater vehicle, and training with the Exploration Planning Operations Center at the Johnson Space Center.[22]

STS-103
In March 1999, Kelly was assigned to STS-103 as a pilot aboardDiscovery, under command ofCurt Brown, on a mission to install new instruments and upgraded systems on theHubble Space Telescope(HST).Discoverylaunched on December 19, 1999, and rendezvoused with the HST after 40 orbits. The STS-103 mission specialists conducted three EVAs to replace gyroscopes and a transmitter, and to install a new computer guidance sensor and recorder. On December 25, 1999, the crew celebrated the only Christmas holiday of the Space Shuttle in orbit with a reading by Curt Brown. After 119 orbits,Discoverylanded at the Kennedy Space Center on December 27, 1999.[18]: 214–230[3]

STS-118
After completing his assignment as a back-up member for ISS Expedition 5 in 2002, Kelly was assigned as commander ofSTS-118aboardEndeavour. After the Space ShuttleColumbiadisaster, STS-118 was delayed until August 2007. STS-118 launched on August 8, 2007. During the launch, the orbiter was struck by nine pieces of foam from theexternal tankjust asColumbiahad been on its final, fatal mission. The underside ofEndeavourwas examined by cameras on the robotic arm and the ISS, and was assessed to not be dangerously damaged. The Shuttle successfully docked with the ISS on August 10.Endeavour's crew successfully added a truss segment, an external spare-parts platform, and a control moment gyroscope to the ISS. The mission was extended to 14 days while testing a new system that enabled docked shuttles to draw electrical power from the station. During the mission, four EVAs to install the new equipment were completed. The mission was ended a day early because of the approach ofHurricane Deantowards Houston. STS-118 completed 201 orbits, and landed on August 21, 2007, at theKennedy Space Center, after 12 days, 17 hours, 55 minutes, and 34 seconds.[23][18]: 246, 259–262[4][24]

Expeditions 25 and 26
In late 2007, Kelly was assigned to Expeditions 25 and 26.[18]: 262–263[25]Kelly lifted off aboardSoyuz TMA-01Mfrom theBaikonur Cosmodromein Kazakhstan at 7:10 pm EDT on October 7, 2010, along with cosmonautsAleksandr KaleriandOleg Skripochka.[26]TMA-01M was the first launch of an updated model of theSoyuzspacecraft, and featured improved guidance, environmental control, and flight-control systems.[27][28]Kelly, Kaleri, and Skripochka arrived at the ISS on October 9, 2010, and joined CommanderDouglas H. Wheelockand flight engineersShannon WalkerandFyodor Yurchikhinon Expedition 25.[5]
During Kelly's time aboard the ISS, the crew supported about 115 scientific experiments, including an improved water-recycling machine, the Boiler Experiment Facility to test heat transfer in microgravity, and a Japanese experiment to research vegetable growth in microgravity. During Expedition 25, cosmonauts Yurchikhin and Skripochka conducted an EVA to install a workstation on theZvezdamodule, install handrails, and removed three Russian experiments.[25]The crew of Expedition 24/25 returned to Earth on November 25, 2010, aboardSoyuz TMA-19; Wheelock transferred command of the station to Kelly.[29]
On December 17, 2010,Soyuz TMA-20arrived at the station with the crew of Expedition 26/27cosmonautDmitri Kondratyev, NASA astronautCatherine Coleman, and ESA astronautPaolo Nespoli.[30]The crew ofSTS-133aboardDiscoveryarrived at the station February 26, 2011. The crew of STS-133 performed two EVAs to replace a pump and install thePermanent Multipurpose Module.Discoveryundocked from the ISS on March 7, 2011, and landed for the final time two days later.[31]
On January 8, 2011, while Kelly was on the ISS, Kelly's sister-in-law CongresswomanGabby Giffordswasshotin Tucson.Soyuz TMA-01Mlanded in Kazakhstan on March 16, 2011, and Kelly traveled toTIRR Memorial Hermannin Houston to see Giffords and Mark.[8][32]Mark was the commander ofSTS-134, the final flight ofEndeavour, and launched on May 16, 2011, with Giffords in attendance.[18]: 300–301, 308–309STS-134 had originally been scheduled to launch in February 2011, which would have made the Kelly brothers the first twins to fly together in space.[33][34]

Expeditions 43–46
NASA began planning for a year-long mission aboard the ISS following a Russian announcement for a similar mission. The primary goal of theyear-long expeditionaboard the orbiting laboratory was to better understand theeffects of spaceflight on the human body.[35]In November 2012, Kelly was selected for a one-year mission to the ISS, but was medically disqualified the following day due to hisvision worsening in microgravity. Kelly appealed to NASA, and was reselected for the mission along with cosmonautMikhail Kornienko.[18]: 309–312
Kelly, Kornienko, andGennady Padalkalaunched aboardSoyuz TMA-16Mspacecraft from theBaikonur Cosmodromein Kazakhstan at 3:42 pm EDT on March 27, 2015.[10][36][37]TMA-16Mdocked with the ISS at 9:36 pm EDT, and the crew joined the Expedition 43 crew of commanderTerry Virtsand flight engineersAnton ShkaplerovandSamantha Cristoforetti. Once aboard, the crew performed scientific experiments, including evaluations of the fluid shifts in their bodies to determine their effects on eyesight, and repeated collections of blood and urine for chemical analysis.[38]During Expedition 43, the ISS received supplies from the SpaceX DragonCRS-6mission, but lost their resupply due to the failure of the RussianProgress 59spacecraft.[39][40]Expedition 44 began on June 11, 2015, when Virts transferred command of the ISS to Padalka, andSoyuz TMA-15Mlanded in Kazakhstan at 9:44 am EDT.[41]
Soyuz TMA-17Mdocked with the ISS on July 22, 2015, bringing NASA astronautKjell Lindgren, Russian cosmonautOleg Kononenko, andJAXAastronautKimiya Yuito join Expedition 44.[42]During Expedition 44, the ISS was resupplied by the JAXAHTV-5and the RussianProgress 60vehicles; the crew experienced another loss of a resupply mission with the SpaceXCRS-7failure.[43][44][45]On August 28, 2016, the crew ofSoyuz TMA-16Mundocked and subsequently docked the spacecraft to a different port to prepare for the arrival ofSoyuz TMA-18M.[46]Soyuz TMA-18Mdocked with the ISS on September 4, 2015, bringing Russian cosmonautSergey Volkov, ESA astronautAndreas Mogensen, and Kazakh cosmonautAidyn Aimbetovto the station.[47]One of SoyuzTMA-18M'smissions was to deliver a newSoyuzto the station for the return of Kelly, Korniyenko, and Volkov in March 2016; they could not return onSoyuz TMA-16Mdue to the 200-day orbital lifespan of aSoyuz.[48]Padalka, Morgensen, and Aimbetov departed from the ISS on September 11, 2015, and landed in Kazakhstan inSoyuz TMA-16M.[49]
Expedition 45 began on September 11, 2015, when Padalka transferred command of the station to Kelly.[49]During the expedition, the ISS crew was resupplied by theProgress 61and theCygnus CRS OA-4missions.[50][51]On October 28, 2015, Kelly and Lindgren performed an EVA to service theCanada Arm 2, theAlpha Magnetic Spectrometer, and to install cables for theInternational Docking Adapterfor theBoeing CST-100 StarlinerandSpaceX Crew Dragonspacecraft.[52][53]Kelly and Lindgren performed a second EVA on November 6, 2015, to service the ammonia cooling system on the P6 truss.[54]Expedition 46 began on December 11, 2015, with the departure ofSoyuz TMA-17M, carrying Lindgren, Kononenko, and Yui.[55]
On December 15, 2015, NASA astronautTimothy Kopra, ESA astronautTimothy Peake, and Russian cosmonautYuri Malenchenkojoined Expedition 46 as flight engineers afterSoyuz TMA-19Mdocked with the ISS.[56]On December 21, 2015, Kelly and Kopra performed an unscheduled EVA to release the brake handles on the Mobile Transporter rail car for the Canada Arm 2, which had unexpectedly stopped when it was remotely commanded by the flight controllers.[53][57]After the successful repair of the Mobile Transporter, the ISS crew was resupplied on December 23, 2015, by theProgress 62spacecraft.[58]On January 15, 2016, Kopra and Peake performed another EVA and successfully replaced a voltage regulator, but were forced to return early after water began forming inside of Kopra's helmet.[59]On January 8, 2016, Kelly appeared in thethank-you notesegment ofThe Tonight Show Starring Jimmy Fallon, with the first ever thank-you note from space.[60]Russian cosmonauts Malenchenko and Volkov conducted an EVA on February 3, 2016, to retrieve experiments and photograph the exterior portions of the Russian segment of the station.[61]On March 1, 2016, Kelly transferred command of the ISS to Kopra, and returned to Earth alongside Korniyenko and Volkov aboardSoyuz TMA-18M. The spacecraft landed in Kazakhstan, and Kelly returned to Houston the following day.[62][63]
In addition to the biological tests conducted on all astronauts on the station, Kelly also participated in comparative study on the effects of spaceflight with his identical twin Mark as the groundcontrol subject. Kelly's cognitive, and genetic traits were measured before and after the flight. Within several months after returning to Earth, Kelly had adapted to living in gravity. Genetic tests revealed changes in Kelly's gene expression, and an increase in the length of histelomeresrelative to before his flight.[64][65][66]

Post-NASA career
On March 12, 2016, Kelly announced his retirement from NASA, effective April 1, 2016.[2]On November 20, 2016, Kelly was appointed United Nations Champion for Space by theUnited Nations Office for Outer Space Affairs(UNOOSA), to assist in raising awareness of UNOOSA outreach and activities.[67][68]In November 2017, a memoir by Kelly was released, calledEndurance: A Year in Space, a Lifetime of Discovery.[18][69]On June 19, 2018, Kelly spoke at the UNISPACE50+ conference inVienna, expressing his views on the possibilities of human potential:
"After spending a year in space, I was absolutely inspired that if we can dream it, we can do it...and most importantly, if we work as a team, because teamwork makes the dream work. The sky is not the limit."[70]

Personal life
On April 25, 1992, Kelly married for the first time, to Leslie (néeYandell), whom he had met while stationed in Virginia Beach.[18]: 160, 165–166Together, they have two children.[18]: 168, 255Kelly and Leslie divorced in 2010.[18]: 268–271In July 2018, Kelly married Amiko Kauderer, a public affairs officer for NASA.[71][72]His sister-in-law isGabby Giffords, a former congresswoman from Arizona.[18]: 262
In 2007, Kelly was successfully treated forprostate cancer. After Kelly received his diagnosis, his brother Mark was also diagnosed and successfully treated.[18]: 263–265

Charity
On October 27, 2022, Kelly became an ambassador for theUNITED24project.[73]In the project, Kelly will help the "Medical Aid" department to collect funds for C-class ambulances.[74]Doctors need several hundred such vehicles, because many ambulances were destroyed during theRussian-Ukrainian war.

Awards and honors
Kelly has received these awards and decorations:[11]
Kelly received an honorary Korolev Diploma from theFederation Aeronautique Internationale(1999) and an Honorary Doctorate of Science degree from theState University of New York(2008).[11]Kelly was featured on the cover ofTimeon December 29, 2014.[75]In 2015, Kelly was listed as one of theTime100 Most Influential People.[76]
Kelly is an associate fellow of theSociety of Experimental Test Pilotsand a member of theAssociation of Space Explorers.[11]
On March 9, 2022, during2022 Russian invasion of Ukraine, Kelly tweeted he will return his Medal "For Merit in Space Exploration" by mailing it to Russian embassy in Washington, telling former Russian presidentDmitry Medvedevto give it to "a Russian mother whose son has died in this unjust war" instead.[77]Kelly and Lt. GeneralMark Hertling, United States Army (retired), tweeted instructions for Russian soldiers to sabotage theirT-72main battle tanks.[78]
On October 27, 2022, Kelly become the ambassador of theUnited24(@u24_gov_ua) fundraising platform and will develop the "Medical aid" direction. His first project will be fundraising for Type Cambulance vehicles.[79]
