Yang Liwei(simplified Chinese:杨利伟;traditional Chinese:楊利偉; born 21 June 1965) is a Chinesemajor general, formermilitary pilot, and formertaikonautof thePeople's Liberation Army.
In October 2003, Yang became the first person sent into space by theChinese space program. This mission,Shenzhou 5, made China the third country to independently send humans into space. He is currently a vice chief designer ofChina Manned Space Engineering.

Early life and education
Yang Liwei was born inSuizhong County,Huludao,Liaoning.[1]His mother was a teacher and his father was an accountant at a state agricultural firm.[2]Yang Liwei married Zhang Yumei with whom they had a son together. Zhang Yumei was a part of the People's Liberation Army and was a teacher in China's Space Program.[3][4]
In 1983, he enlisted for thePeople's Liberation Army(PLA) and was admitted to theAir Force Second Flight Academy(空军第二飞行学院), graduating in 1987 with a bachelor's degree.[5]He participated in the screening process for astronauts in 1996.[6]In the PLAAF, he logged 1,350 hours of flight time as a fighter pilot before he went to space training.[1]
Yang enteredTsinghua Universityin Beijing fordoctoral studiesin 2004 and received aDoctor of PhilosophyinManagementin 2009.[7][8]

Spaceflight career
Yang was selected as a taikonaut candidate in 1998 and has trained for space flight since then.[2]He was chosen from the final pool of 14 candidates to fly on China's firstcrewed space mission.[9]A former fighter pilot in the Aviation Military Unit of the PLA, he held the rank ofLieutenant Colonelat the time of his mission.[2]He was promoted to fullColonelon 20 October 2003.[10]According to theYouth Daily, the decision had been made in advance of his spaceflight without Yang being made aware of it.[10]
The launch window ofShenzhou 5, was chosen to be 15 October 2003 because it would coincide with the conclusion of a Communist Party conference in Beijing and a day beforePresident Hu Jintao's visit to Thailand for theAsia-Pacific Economic Cooperation (APEC)summit.[9]President Huwas present at the launch site to supervise the launch ofShenzhou 5.[9]The launch was not broadcast on live television to prevent negative publicity in the event of a disaster.
He was launched into space aboard hisShenzhou 5spacecraft atop aLong March 2Frocket fromJiuquan Satellite Launch Centerin theGobi Desertat 09:00CST(01:00UTC) on 15 October 2003.[11][12]Prior to his launch almost nothing was made public about the Chinese taikonaut candidates; his selection for the Shenzhou 5 launch was only leaked to the media one day before the launch.[1]The other two potential candidates for the space mission wereNie HaishengandZhai Zhigangwho were also on standby as backup crews on the day of the launch.[9]
Yang Liwei reported the occurrence of abnormal vibrations two minutes after launch which he described as "very uncomfortable". The vibrations were later discovered to have come from the launcher rocket.[9]As a consequence, corrective measures were swiftly taken to the design of the followingCZ-2Fcarrier rocket for theShenzhou-6.[13]
Yang punctuated his journey with regular updates on his condition; variations of "I feel good", the last coming as the capsule floated to the ground after re-entry.[14][15]He spoke to his wife as the Shenzhou 5 started its eighth orbit around the Earth, assuring her from space: "I feel very good, don't worry".[14][15]He ate specially designed packets of shredded pork with garlic,Kung Pao chickenandeight treasurerice, along with Chinese herbaltea.[10]During the flight, Yang slept two times in 3-hour intervals.[9]In the middle of the journey, state television broadcast footage of Yang waving a small flag of the People's Republic of China and that of theUnited Nationsinside his capsule.[10][15]
State media said Yang's capsule was supplied with a gun, a knife and tent in case he landed in the wrong place.[15]
Yang's craft landed in the grasslands of the Chinese region ofInner Mongoliaat around 06:30 CST on 16 October 2003 (22:00 UTC), having completed 14orbitsand travelled more than600,000 km.[15]Yang was in space for a total of 21 hours,[12]Yang left the capsule about 15 minutes after landing, and was congratulated byPremierWen Jiabao.[15]But the astronaut's bleeding lips seen in the official images broadcast sparked rumors of a hard landing confirmed by accounts of personnel present at the landing site.[16]
Although the first Chinese citizen in space, Yang Liwei is not the first person of Chinese origin in space.Shanghai-bornTaylor Wangflew onSpace ShuttlemissionSTS-51-Bin 1985.[17]Wang, however, had become a United States citizen in 1975.[17]Taylor Wang was not the first person born in China to go to orbit.William Anderswas born in Hong Kong on 17 October 1933.[18]Anders would be a part of theApollo 8lunar orbital mission in 1968.[18]
Yang visited Hong Kong on 31 October 2003, holding talks and sharing his experiences during a six-day stay in the territory.[19]The visit coincided with an exhibition that featured his reentry capsule, spacesuit and leftover food from his 21-hour mission. On 5 November he travelled toMacau.[19]
On 7 November, Yang received the title of "Space Hero" fromJiang Zemin, the Chairman of the PRCCentral Military Commission(CMC).[1]He also received a badge of honour during a ceremony at theGreat Hall of the People. Russia awarded him theGagarin medal.[20]TheChinese University of Hong Konghas given Yang an honorary doctorate.[1]
Theasteroid21064 Yangliweiand thefossil birdDalingheornis liweiiare named after him.[1][21]

After Shenzhou 5
In a move similar to that taken by theSoviet Unionwith national space flight heroYuri Gagarin, an official decision to no longer assign him to future spaceflight missions was made.[citation needed]Yang was promoted to Major General on 22 July 2008.[22]
After the successful space flight of Shenzhou 5, Yang was given the position of vice-commander-in-chief of the astronauts system of China's crewed spaceflight project.[23]
Yang became an alternate of theCentral Committee of the Chinese Communist Partyat the 17th Party Congress in October 2007.
TheUnited Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organizationawarded the UNESCO Medal on Space Science to Yang in October 2017.[24]
Yang Liwei is the director of theChina Manned Space Engineering Office.[25]
