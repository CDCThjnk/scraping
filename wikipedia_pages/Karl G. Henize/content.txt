Karl Gordon Henize(/ˈhɛnaɪz/;[1]October 17, 1926 – October 5, 1993) was an Americanastronomer,space scientist, NASAastronaut, and professor atNorthwestern University. He was stationed at several observatories around the world, includingMcCormick Observatory,Lamont–Hussey Observatory(South Africa),Mount Wilson Observatory,Smithsonian Astrophysical ObservatoryandMount Stromlo Observatory(Australia). He was a member of the astronaut support crew forApollo 15andSkylab 2,3, and4. As amission specialiston theSpacelab-2mission (STS-51-F), he flew onSpace ShuttleChallengerin July/August 1985. He was awarded theNASA Exceptional Scientific Achievement Medalin 1974.
He died in 1993, during aMount Everestexpedition while testing equipment for NASA.

Early life and education
Karl Henize was born inCincinnati, Ohio, on October 17, 1926.[2]He grew up on a small dairy farm outside Cincinnati, and his boyhood heroes wereBuck Rogersand SirEdmund Hillary, the first man to reach the summit of Mount Everest.[1]Henize was fascinated with space at a young age. Since space travel had not happened yet during his childhood, he became interested in astronomy. Henize built his own telescopes and read every book on astronomy in his school's library. He joined theBoy Scouts, and his only merit badge was in astronomy.[3]
His hobbies included homecomputers,stamp collecting,mathematics, andastronomy, and he also enjoyedracquetball,baseball, skindiving, andmountain climbing.
Henize attended elementary school inPlainvilleandMariemont, Ohio. The school was small, three or four rooms, and did not contain a library.[3]He also attended high school in Mariemont, where he played baseball and was on the tumbling team.[3]Due to the war, Karl elected to not finish high school, instead entering theV-12 Navy College Training Program, which first took him toDenison Universityin Granville, Ohio, and then to theUniversity of Virginia. World War II ended before he received his Naval Commission, so he became a member of theU.S. Naval Reserve, reaching the rank oflieutenant commanderand retained a draft status of A1 until being required to give that up when he became an astronaut in 1967. While at theUniversity of Virginia, he received aBachelor of Artsdegree inmathematicsin 1947,[2]and aMaster of Artsdegree inastronomyin 1948,[2]while also carrying out research atMcCormick Observatory. He was awarded aDoctor of Philosophyin astronomy in 1954 by theUniversity of Michigan.[2][4]
Henize married CarolinenéeWeberin Ann Arbor, and they had four children: Kurt, Marcia, Skye, and Vance.[5]

Experience
Henize was an observer for the University of Michigan Observatory from 1948 to 1951, stationed at theLamont–Hussey ObservatoryinBloemfontein,Union of South Africa. While there, he conducted an objective-prism spectroscopic survey of the southern sky for stars and nebulae showing emission lines ofhydrogen.
In 1954 he became a Carnegie post-doctoral fellow at theMount Wilson ObservatoryinPasadena, California, and conducted spectroscopic and photometric studies of emission-line stars and nebulae. From 1956 to 1959, he served as a seniorastronomerat theSmithsonian Astrophysical Observatory. He was in charge of photographicsatellite tracking stationsfor the satellite tracking program and responsible for the establishment and operation of a global network of 12 stations for photographic tracking of artificial Earth satellites.[6]
Henize was appointedassociate professorinNorthwestern University's Department ofAstronomyin 1959 and was awarded a professorship in 1964. In addition to teaching, he conducted research on planetarynebulae,peculiar emission-line stars,S-type stars, andT-associations. During 1961 and 1962, he was a guest observer atMount Stromlo ObservatoryinCanberra,Australia, where he used instruments ranging from the Uppsala 20/26-inch schmidt to the 74-inch parabolic reflector.
Henize also engaged in studies ofultravioletoptical systems and astronomical programs suited to the crewed space flight program. He became principal investigator ofexperiment S-013which obtainedultraviolet stellar spectraduring theGemini10, 11, and 12 flights.[2]He also became principal investigator of experiment S-019 in which a 6-inch aperture objective-prism spectrograph was used onSkylabto obtain ultraviolet spectra of faint stars.
From 1974 to 1978 Henize chaired theNASA Facility Definition TeamforSTARLAB, a proposed 1-meter UV telescope forSpacelab. From 1978 to 1980 he chaired the NASA Working Group for theSpacelab Wide-Angle Telescope. Since 1979 he had been the chairman of the International Astronomical Union Working Group for Space Schmidt Surveys and was one of the leaders in proposing the use of a 1-meter (3 ft) all-reflecting Schmidt telescope to carry out a deep full-sky survey in far-ultraviolet wavelengths.
He authored or co-authored 70scientific publicationsdealing with astronomy research.[7]

NASA experience
Henize applied for the first scientist-astronaut group, but was denied because the age limit was 35 and he was 37. In 1967, NASA abolished the age limit, and Henize was selected as a scientist-astronaut by NASA in August.[5][8]Astronauts that did not already know how to fly had to complete a 53-week jet pilot training program atVance Air Force Base, Oklahoma.[5]They also completed initial education there. He was a member of the astronaut support crew and CAPCOM for theApollo 15mission.[2]The entire support crew consisted of scientist-astronauts, as the prime crew of the mission thought they would need more help with the science aspects of the mission rather than the piloting.[9]He was also a member of the astronaut support crew for theSkylab 2,3, and4missions.[10]He was mission specialist for the ASSESS-2 spacelab simulation mission in 1977. He logged 2,300 hours flying time injet aircraft.[7]
Henize was a mission specialist on theSpacelab-2mission (STS-51-F) which launched fromKennedy Space Center, Florida, on July 29, 1985. He was accompanied by Col.Gordon Fullerton(spacecraft commander), Col.Roy D. Bridges(pilot), fellow mission specialists Dr.Anthony W. Englandand Dr.F. Story Musgrave, as well as two payload specialists, Dr.Loren Actonand Dr.John-David Bartoe.
This mission was the first pallet-only Spacelab mission and the first mission to operate the SpacelabInstrument Pointing System(IPS). It carried 13 major experiments, of which seven were in the field of astronomy and solar physics, three were for studies of the Earth'sionosphere, two were life science experiments, and one studied the properties ofsuperfluid helium. Henize's responsibilities included testing and operating the IPS, operating theRemote Manipulator System(RMS), maintaining the Spacelab systems, and operating several of the experiments.
After 126 orbits of the Earth, STS 51-FChallengerlanded at Edwards Air Force Base, California, on August 6, 1985. With the completion of this flight Henize logged 190 hours in space.[11]
In 1986, he retired as an astronaut and accepted a position as senior scientist in the Space Sciences Branch. He studied space debris and hazards to the space station.[4]
In the 1998 miniseriesFrom the Earth to the Moon, Henize was played byMarc Macaulay.

Death
Henize, on leave from NASA at the time, went on a hiking expedition to Mount Everest with British research group High Adventure BVI.[4]Henize intended to test the Tissue Equivalent Proportional Counter (TEPC) at different altitudes: 17,000 feet (5,200 m), 19,000 feet (5,800 m), and 21,000 feet (6,400 m). The TEPC would reveal how people's bodies would be affected, including the way bodily tissues behaved, when struck by radiation, which was important for the planning of long duration space missions.[12]The data would be shared with NASA and BVI.[13]
Henize acclimatized atKathmandu, Nepal, followed by acclimatization at expedition base camp in China. Henize, with three members of High Adventure BVI, began the hike on October 4, 1993. Henize reported breathing problems on their way to advanced base camp; they were at 22,000 feet (6,700 m). Treatments with oxygen failed, and they returned to base camp. On October 5, Henize died in his sleep. The cause of death was determined to behigh altitude pulmonary edema(HAPE).[14][15]Henize, aged 66, was buried near theChangtse Glacier.[16]He was survived by his wife, Caroline, and four children.[13]

Organizations
Henize was a member of theAmerican Astronomical Society; theRoyal Astronomical Society; theAstronomical Society of the Pacific; theInternational Astronomical Union; andPhi Beta Kappa.[17]

Special honors
He was presented theRobert Gordon Memorial Awardfor 1968, and was a  recipient ofNASA Group Achievement Awardsin 1971, 1974, 1975, 1978. He was also awarded theNASA Exceptional Scientific Achievement Medalin 1974.[17]

Writings
In 1956, Henize published theCatalogues of Hα-Emission Stars and Nebulae in the Magellanic Clouds.[18]The paper references many objects which bear his name, such as  theSuperbubbleHenize 70[19]and theplanetary nebulaHenize 3–401.[20]He discovered over 2,000 stars. In total, he published 75 papers.[4]
