He completed 134 combat missions as anRF-4Cweapon systems officerwhile stationed atTan Son Nhut Air Base,Vietnam, from January to November 1969.  He subsequently served a 4-year tour of duty, in England. In July 1976, upon completing the USAF Flight Test Engineer Course atEdwards Air Force Base,California, he was assigned as a flight test weapon systems officer to the 3246th Test Wing atEglin Air Force Base,Florida.[1][4]

NASA career
Selected by NASA in January 1978,[5]Mullane became an astronaut in August 1979.  He flew on threeSpace Shuttlemissions, serving as a mission specialist on the crew ofSTS-41-Din August 1984, onSTS-27in December 1988, and onSTS-36in March 1990.
On his first mission Mullane served as a mission specialist on the crew of STS-41-D, which launched fromKennedy Space Center, Florida, on August 30, 1984. This was the maiden flight of theOrbiterDiscovery.  During this seven-day mission the crew successfully activated the OAST-1solar cellwing experiment, deployed threesatellites, operated the CFES-III experiment, the studentcrystalgrowth experiment, andphotographyexperiments using theIMAXmotion picturecamera.  STS 41-D completed 96 orbits of the Earth in 145 hours before landing at Edwards Air Force Base, California, on September 5, 1984.
Mullane then was assigned toSTS-62-A, the first Shuttle mission scheduled to launch fromVandenberg Air Force Base, but the mission was canceled after theSpace ShuttleChallengerdisaster. After the Shuttle returned to service, he flew aboard the OrbiterAtlantis, onSTS-27, which launched from Kennedy Space Center, Florida, on December 2, 1988.  The mission carried aDepartment of Defense(DOD) payload, as well as a number of secondary payloads. After 68 orbits of the earth, the mission concluded with a dry lakebed landing on Runway 17 at Edwards Air Force Base, California, on December 6, 1988. Mission duration was 105 hours. The mission is noteworthy due to the severe damage Atlantis sustained to its critical heat-resistant tiles during ascent.
On his third flight, Mullane served on the crew of STS-36, which launched from the Kennedy Space Center, Florida, on February 28, 1990, aboard the Space ShuttleAtlantis.  This mission carried DOD payloads and a number of secondary payloads.  After 72 orbits of the earth, the STS-36 mission concluded with a lakebed landing at Edwards Air Force Base, California, on March 4, 1990.
With the completion of his third flight, Mullane logged a total of 356 hours in space.  He retired from NASA and the Air Force July 1, 1990.[6]

Post-NASA career
In 2006, Mullane published an autobiography,Riding Rockets: The Outrageous Tales of a Space Shuttle Astronaut, that details his life before and during the space program, and expresses critical views towards the culture of the NASA Astronaut Corps.[7]Mullane appeared on the United States television showThe Daily Show with Jon Stewarton Monday, February 13, 2006, to promote his book.[citation needed]
