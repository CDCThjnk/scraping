While assigned to VF-2, Rominger attended theNavy Fighter Weapons School(TOPGUN). In 1987 he completed the Naval Postgraduate School/Test Pilot School Cooperative Program, and was assigned as F-14 Project Officer to the Carrier Suitability Branch of the Strike Aircraft Test Directorate atNaval Air Station Patuxent River,Maryland. During his tour of duty, Rominger completed the initial carrier suitability sea trials of the F-14B, logging the first aircraft carrier arrestment and catapult launch in the upgraded Tomcat. In September 1990, he reported to Fighter Squadron 211 (VF-211), where he served as Operations Officer and completed aDesert StormDeployment to thePersian GulfaboardUSSNimitz.
He has logged over 5,000 flying hours in over 35 types of aircraft and 685 carrier landings.

NASA career
Selected by NASA in March 1992, Rominger reported to the Johnson Space Center in August 1992. He completed one year of training and qualified for assignment as a pilot on futureSpace Shuttleflight crews. Rominger was initially assigned to work technical issues for the Astronaut Office Operations Development Branch. He also served as Chief of the Astronaut Office Shuttle Operations Branch, and deputy director, Flight Crew Operations. A veteran of five space flights, Rominger has logged over 1,600 hours in space These were all as a STS Orbiter crew member, the highest total in this category. He flew as pilot onSTS-73in 1995,STS-80in 1996 andSTS-85in 1997, and was crew commander onSTS-96in 1999 andSTS-100in 2001. Rominger served as Chief of the Astronaut Office and professional head of theNASA Astronaut Corpsfrom 2002 to 2006, responsible for the mission preparation activities of all Space Shuttle and futureInternational Space Stationcrews and their support personnel.

Space flight experience
STS-73 inSpace ShuttleColumbia(October 20 to November 5, 1995) was the second United States Microgravity Laboratory mission. The mission focused onmaterials science,biotechnology,combustion science,fluid dynamics, and numerous scientific experiments housed in the pressurizedSpacelabmodule. In completing his first space flight, Rominger orbited the Earth 256 times, traveled over 6 million miles, and logged a total of 15 days, 21 hours, and 52 minutes in space.[3]
STS-80, also inColumbia(November 19 to December 7, 1996) was a 17-day mission during which the crew deployed and retrieved the Wake Shield Facility (WSF) and the Orbiting Retrievable Far and Extreme Ultraviolet Spectrometer (ORFEUS) satellites. The free-flying WSF created a super vacuum in its wake and grew thin film wafers for use insemiconductorsand other high-tech electrical components. The ORFEUS instruments, mounted on the reusableShuttle Pallet Satellite, studied the origin and makeup of stars. In completing his second space flight, Rominger orbited the Earth a record 278 times, traveled over 7 million miles and logged 17 days, 15 hours and 53 minutes in space.
STS-85 inSpace ShuttleDiscovery(August 7–19, 1997) was a 12-day mission during which the crew deployed and retrieved theCRISTA-SPASsatellite, operated the Japanese Manipulator Flight Demonstration (MFD) robotic arm, studied changes in theEarth's atmosphereand tested technology destined for use on the futureInternational Space Station. The mission was accomplished in 189 Earth orbits, traveling 4.7 million miles in 11 days, 20 hours and 27 minutes.[3]
STS-96, also inDiscovery, (May 27 to June 6, 1999) was a 10-day mission during which the crew delivered 4 tons of logistics and supplies to the International Space Station in preparation for the arrival of the first crew to live on the station. The mission included the first docking of a Space Shuttle to the International Space Station and was accomplished in 153 Earth orbits, traveling 4 million miles in 9 days, 19 hours and 13 minutes.[3]
STS-100, inSpace ShuttleEndeavour(April 19 to May 1, 2001) was a 12-day mission during which the crew installed the Canadian-built Robotic Arm and the Rafaello Logistics Module to the International Space Station.Endeavourwas docked 8-days on the most complex robotics flight in the history of the Space Shuttle program and was made up of a very diverse international crew, representing the United States, Russia, Canada and Italy. The mission was completed in 187 Earth orbits, traveling 4.9 million miles in 11 days, 21 hours and 30 minutes.[3]

Organizations
He is a member of theAssociation of Space Explorers, theSociety of Experimental Test Pilots, theAmerican Institute of Aeronautics and Astronautics, theAssociation of Naval Aviation,The Mars Generation, and theChi EpsilonCivil Engineering Society.

Awards and honors
He has been awarded theDefense Superior Service Medal, theDistinguished Flying Cross, theDefense Meritorious Service Medaland theNASA Distinguished Service Medal.  He is a Distinguished Graduate of theU.S. Naval Test Pilot Schooland was theNaval Air Test CenterTest Pilot of the Year in 1988. He received the Society of Experimental Test PilotsRay E. Tenhoff Awardin 1990, theJack NorthropAward in 1996, and the Colorado State University Distinguished Service Award in 1997. He was named West Coast Tomcat Fighter Pilot of the Year in 1992 and was listed in the Top Ten Carrier Landing Distinction in Airwings Two and Nine. In 2000 he was nominated and inducted into theColorado Aviation Hall of Fame.[4]He is an inductee into theUnited States Astronaut Hall of Fame.[5]
