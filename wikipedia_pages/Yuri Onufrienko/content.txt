Col.Yuri Ivanovich Onufrienko(Russian:Юрий Иванович Онуфриенко,Ukrainian:Юрій Іванович Онуфрієнко; born 6 February 1961) is a retired Russiancosmonaut. He is a veteran of two extended spaceflights, aboard the space stationMirin 1996 and aboard theInternational Space Stationin 2001–2002.

Personal
Onufrienko was born inRyasne,Zolochiv RaionofKharkiv Oblast,Soviet Union(nowUkraine). Onufrienko and his wife, Valentina Mikhailovna Onufrienko, have two sons, Yuri, born in 1982 and Aleksandr, born in 1990 and one daughter, Elena, born in 1988. He has two older brothers and his parents are deceased. Onufrienko enjoystennis,cooking,fishing,chess, andaviation.[1]

Education
Onufrienko graduated from the V.M. Komarov Eisk Higher Military Aviation School for Pilots in 1982 with a pilot-engineer'sdiploma. In 1994, Onufrienko earned a degree incartographyfromMoscow State University.

Awards
Onufrienko was awarded theHero of Russiamedal, the title of Pilot-Cosmonaut of the Russian Federation, the Gold Star Medal of the Hero of the Russian Federation and NASA Space Flight and Public Service Medals. In 1997 he was named aChevalierin the FrenchLegion of Honor.

Experience
Onufrienko served as apilotin theSoviet(laterRussian) Air Force, where he logged over 800 flight hours. He has flown theL-29,Sukhoi Su-7,Sukhoi Su-17(M1-4), andL-39.

Cosmonaut career
Onufrienko was selected as a cosmonaut candidate in 1989. From September 1989 to January 1991, he underwent a course of general space training. Starting April 1991, he underwent training as a member of test cosmonauts group. Starting March 1994, he entered flight training to be the commander of the stand-by crew of theMir-18expedition aboard theSoyuz TM-21spacecraft and theMirspace station as part of theShuttle-Mir program.

Mir EO-21
From February 21 to September 2, 1996, Onufrienko served as commander of the  Mir EO-21 expedition. TheSoyuz TM-23spacecraft carrying Onufrienko with cosmonautYury Usachovlifted off from theBaikonur Cosmodromeon February 21, 1996, at 12:34:05 UTC. After two days of autonomous flight, the Soyuz spacecraft docked with the Mir space station's forward-facing port on February 23 at 14:20 UTC.[2]One month later, he and Yuri Usachov were joined byNASAastronautShannon Lucid. During Mir-21 Onufrienko performed numerous research experiments including Protein crystal growth experiments experiments in materials science using high temperature melting oven "Optizon". The new modulePriroda, the seventh and final module of the Mir Space Station arrived on April 26, 1996.[3]Its primary purpose was to conduct Earth resource experiments throughremote sensingand to develop and verify remote sensing methods. During Mir EO-21 supplies arrived with theProgress M-31spacecraft. Onufrienko and Yuri Usachov were joined by French astronautClaudie André-Deshaysafter the departure of Shannon Lucid.
On September 2, 1996, Onufrienko, Usachev and Claudie André-Deshays returned to Earth on board the Soyuz TM-23 capsule. The spacecraft landed at 07:41:40 UTC 108 km south west ofAkmola(Tselinograd). Altogether, on board Soyuz TM-23 and Mir, Onufrienko logged 193 days in space.

Expedition 4
Onufrienko again served as commander on ISSExpedition 4.[4]Onufrienko returned to space on boardSpace ShuttleEndeavour'sSTS-108mission. Launched on December 5, 2001, at 22:19:28 UTC from theKennedy Space Center,Endeavourdocked with theInternational Space Station(ISS) on December 7, 2001, at 20:03 UTC.[5]The primary objective of STS-108 was to deliver supplies to and help maintain the ISS. During a6+1⁄2-month stay aboard the ISS, the 3 member Expedition 4 crew (Onufrienko and NASA astronautsDaniel W. BurschandCarl E. Walz) performed flight tests of the station hardware, conducted internal and external maintenance tasks, and developed the capability of the station to support the addition of science experiments.[6]TheExpedition 4crew returned to Earth aboardSTS-111, withEndeavourlanding atEdwards Air Force Base, California, on June 19, 2002. In completing this mission, Onufrienko logged an additional 196 days in space, for a total of 389 days of spaceflight.

Spacewalks
Onufrienko has performed eight career spacewalks totaling 42 hours and 33 minutes. As of June 2010, he has secured the11th positionin the list of astronauts who have the most spacewalk time. Onufrienko performed six spacewalks during his stay on board the Mir Space Station and performed another two during his visit to the ISS.
Onufrienko performed his first career spacewalk on 15 March 1996. He and cosmonaut Usachov started the spacewalk at 01:04 UTC. They installed the second Strela boom and prepared for Mir Cooperative Solar Array (MCSA) installation. The spacewalk lasted 5 hours and 51 minutes.
On 20 May 1996 Onufrienko performed his second career spacewalk. The spacewalk started at 22:50 UTC and ended at 04:10 UTC clocking 5 hours and 20 minutes. During the spacewalk, the two cosmonauts removed the Mir cooperative solar array (MCSA) from its stowed position on the exterior of the docking module at the base of theKristallmodule. They used the Strela boom to reach and move the array to theKvant-1module. The two spacewalkers also inflated an aluminum and nylon pup-up model of a Pepsi Cola can, which they then filmed against the backdrop of Earth.[7]ThePepsi Colacompany paid for the procedure and planned to use the film in a television commercial. However, the commercial never aired—reportedly because Pepsi later changed the design of the can.
Onufrienko performed his third career spacewalk on 24 May 1996. He and cosmonaut Usachov started the spacewalk at 22:50 UTC. They installed the MCSA on theKvant-1module. The spacewalk lasted 5 hours and 34 minutes.
On 30 May 1996, Onufrienko ventured outside the Mir Space Station to conduct his fourth career spacewalk. He and cosmonaut Usachov started the spacewalk at 18:20 UTC. They installed the modular optoelectrical multispectral scanner (MOMS) outsidePrirodaand handrails on theKvant-2module to facilitate moving around outside the station during future extravehicular activities. MOMS was used to study the Earth's atmosphere and environment. The spacewalk lasted 4 hours and 20 minutes.
On 6 June 1996, Onufrienko performed his fifth career spacewalk. He and Usachov installed micrometeoroid detectors and replaced cassettes in the Swiss/Russian Komza experiment and installed the Particle Impact Experiment, the Mir Sample Return Experiment, and the SKK-11 cassette, which exposed construction materials to space conditions.[7]The spacewalk lasted 3 hours and 34 minutes.
Onufrienko performed his sixth career spacewalk on 13 June 1996. The spacewalk started at 12:45 UTC and ended at 18:27 UTC clocking 5 hours and 42 minutes. During the spacewalk, Onufrienko and Usachov installed the Rapana truss structure (an experiment mounting point) to the Kvant-1 module. Onufrienko and Usachev also manually deployed the saddle-shaped traverse synthetic aperture radar antenna on Priroda. The large antenna had failed to open fully after receiving commands from inside Mir.
Onufrienko performed his seventh career spacewalk on January 14, 2002.[8][9]The space walk was based out of thePirsAirlock and used Russian Orlan space suits. Onufrienko and NASA astronaut Carl Walz relocated the cargo boom for the Russian Strela crane. They moved the boom from Pressurized Mating Adapter (PMA 1) to the exterior of thePirsDocking Compartment. The crew also installed an amateur radio antenna onto the end of the Zvezda Service Module.[10]The spacewalk lasted 6 hours and 3 minutes.
Onufrienko performed his eighth career spacewalk on January 25, 2002, when he and NASA astronaut Daniel Bursch ventured out into space from thePirsairlock.[8]During the spacewalk, Onufrienko and Bursch installed six deflector shields for theZvezdaService Module's jet thrusters. Also, they installed an amateur radio antenna. 
The two spacewalkers also removed an experiment called Kromka situated near one of the thruster groups and installed a virtually identical new Kromka experiment in the same place. The experiment captured material that results from thruster firings. Onufrienko and Bursch also attached a physics experiment called Platan to theZvezdamodule. Platan was designed to capture low-energy heavy nuclei from the Sun and from outside theSolar System. In addition, they installed three materials experiments, called SKK for their Russian acronym, on theZvezdamodule. The experiments examine effects of the harsh environment of space on a wide range of materials.[11]The spacewalk lasted 5 hours and 59 minutes.
