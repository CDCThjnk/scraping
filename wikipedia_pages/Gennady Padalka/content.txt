Padalka is a recipient of theHero Star of the Russian Federationand the title of Russian Federation Test-Cosmonaut.[10]He is decorated with Fatherland Service Medal fourth class, Medals of the Russian Federation and also Medal of the International Fund of Cosmonautics support for Service to Cosmonautics. Padalka is a prize winner of the Russian Federation Government in the field of science and technology.[12]

Cosmonaut career
Gennady Padalka was selected as acosmonautcandidate to start training at theGagarin Cosmonaut Training Centerin 1989. From June 1989 to January 1991, he attended basic space training and in 1991 was qualified as a test-cosmonaut.

MirMission
On 13 August 1998, Gennady launched withSergei AvdeyevaboardSoyuz TM-28to become the crew ofMirExpedition 26, whose primary mission was to make repairs to life support systems and prepare the station for deorbit, which was to take place afterExpedition 27. On 8 February 1999 at 11:23 GMT Padalka and Avdeyev undocked fromMir's -X port in Soyuz TM-28, and redocked at the +X Kvant port at 11:39 GMT, freeing up the front port for theSoyuz TM-29docking.[13]He returned to Earth on board the Soyuz TM-28 capsule on 28 February 1999. The Soyuz TM-28 undocked from the Kvant rear docking port on 27 February at 22:52 GMT and landed in Kazakhstan on 28 February at 02:14 GMT. Padalka accumulated 198 days and 16 hours of space travel during the mission.

ISS Missions
From June 1999 to July 2000, Padalka trained for a space flight on aSoyuz-TMtransport vehicle as anISScontingency crew commander. From August 2000 to November 2001, he trained for a space flight as theExpedition 4back-up crew commander.
In March 2002 Padalka was assigned as commander of the ISSExpedition 9crew. Expedition 9 was launched from theBaikonur Cosmodrome,Kazakhstanaboard theSoyuz TMA-4spacecraft, and docked with the ISS on 21 April 2004. Following a week of joint operations and handover briefings, they replaced theExpedition 8crew who returned to Earth. In a six-monthtour of dutyaboard the station Padalka continued ISS science operations, maintained Station systems, and performed four spacewalks. The Expedition 9 mission concluded after undocking and landed back in Kazakhstan on 23 October 2004. In completing this mission, Padalka logged an additional 187 days, 21 minutes and 17 seconds in space, and 15 hours, 45 minutes and 22 seconds of EVA time.
Padalka returned to the ISS in 2009 to serve as commander of Expeditions19and20.[14][15]He commanded theSoyuz TMA-14spacecraft which was launched from Baikonur on 26 March 2009 and docked with the ISS two days later. Padalka also commanded the first six-personspace stationcrew (Expedition 20), returning to Earth on 11 October 2009.[16]
In May 2012 Padalka returned to the ISS for a third time. He served as a flight engineer as part ofExpedition 31before graduating to commandExpedition 32.[17]
He launched to the ISS aboardSoyuz TMA-04Mon 15 May 2012, along with fellow crew membersSergei RevinandJoseph Acaba[18]and arrived at the space station on 17 May at 4:36UTC.[19]He, along with Revin and Acaba, returned to Earth on 17 September 2012.[citation needed]
Padalka returned to the ISS aboardSoyuz TMA-16MduringExpedition 43andExpedition 44, along withMikhail KorniyenkoandScott Kelly. He landed on Soyuz TMA-16M on 12 September 2015. Padalka set the record for most time in space of anyone in history that stayed untilOleg Kononenkobroke this record on February 4, 2024 at 07:30:08 UTC and is currently at 2nd position.[1][2][3]

Retirement
In April 2017, it was announced that Padalka had filed his resignation from the Roscosmos cosmonaut corps. Padalka himself explained his decision by the fact that he has only a small chance to join any space mission in the near future. "I had to resign. I am tired of doing nothing. There are no prospects that I will fly [to the International Space Station (ISS)]," he told TASS, explaining his decision.

Spacewalks
On 15 September 1998 Padalka performed the first spacewalk of his career during a stay aboard Mir along with Sergei Avdeyev. After donning spacesuits, the PKhO compartment of theMir Core Modulewas depressurized and the spacewalkers entered the deadSpektrmodule at 20:00 GMT. The crew reconnected some cables for the solar panel steering mechanism and closed the hatch a half hour later. The PKhO was then repressurized after a spacewalk which lasted 30 minutes.
On 10 November 1998 Padalka and Avdeyev again ventured out into space. The two made the EVA from theKvant-2airlock on Mir. The starting time of the spacewalk was at 19:24 GMT. The two spacewalking cosmonauts installed a meteoroid detector in for the upcoming Leonid shower, and hand-launched the Sputnik-41 amateur-radio mini-satellite. The space walk concluded at 01:18 GMT on 11 November, clocking a total time of 5 hours and 54 minutes.
Padalka's third spacewalk was performed on 24 June 2004 from the ISS'sPirsDocking Compartment. The spacewalk was cut short due to a spacesuit malfunction of his fellow spacewalking partner, NASA astronautMichael Fincke.[20]After Fincke egressed, within minutes flight controllers noticed a decrease in pressure in his primary oxygen tank. Although the spacewalk was planned for six hours, as a result of the problems it only lasted 14 minutes.
On 30 June 2004 Padalka performed his fourth spacewalk along with astronaut Michael Fincke. The duo successfully repaired a faulty circuit breaker on the space station an hour ahead of schedule.[21]During their repair job, the two spacewalkers replaced a failed device called a remote power control module (RPCM) that had cut off power to its gyroscope. The spacewalk lasted 5 hours and 40 minutes.
On 3 August 2004 Gennady Padalka and Mike Fincke again left the space station to install communications gear and replace space exposure experiments on the outside of theZvezdaService Module.[22]The spacewalk was conducted from thePirsDocking Compartment airlock and commenced when Padalka and Fincke opened the outer hatch of the airlock at 6:58 GMT. During the spacewalk the two spacewalkers removed six obsolete laser reflectors used for docking and replaced four of them with newer versions. The crew also installed two antennas to allow theAutomated Transfer Vehicle(ATV) to communicate with the space station and removed a cable from a faulty television camera. The 4 hour 20 minute excursion out of the ISS marked Padalka's fifth career spacewalk.
Padalka completed his sixth career spacewalk on 3 September 2004 when he and Mike Fincke ventured out into space. The spacewalk took place outside theZvezdamodule. Padalka and Fincke began the spacewalk at 16:43 GMT, after emerging from thePirsairlock.[23]On theZaryamodule, the two spacewalkers replaced a pump control panel that measures the module's coolant levels. They also installed three communications antennas at its aft end of theZvezdamodule. The spacewalk lasted 5 hours and 21 minutes.
Padalka completed his seventh career spacewalk on 5 June 2009.[24]He and NASA astronautMichael Barrattegressed outside the ISS beginning at 7:52 UTC to install docking system antennas and cabling to accommodate theMini Research Module 2(MRM-2). The spacewalk began at an hour behind schedule because of higher than expected carbon-dioxide levels in the spacesuits. The spacewalk ended when the two crew members returned to thePirsDocking Compartment airlock at 12:46 GMT. The spacewalk lasted 4 hours and 54 minutes.
On 10 June 2009 Gennady Padalka and Michael Barratt entered the transfer compartment in theZvezdamodule.[25]The "internal spacewalk" began 10 minutes behind schedule because of initial problems with pressure inside the airlock, which did not fall as fast as expected. While they were not in open space outside the ISS, Padalka and Barratt had to wear space suits in the depressurized compartment. During the 12 minute spacewalk the two crew members moved a docking mechanism to accommodate the MRM-2. The event marked the eighth career spacewalk for Padalka.
On 20 August 2012 Padalka, together with cosmonautYuri Malenchenko, participated in his ninth career spacewalk.[26]Tasks assigned to the two cosmonauts included hardware relocations, installations, retrievals, and deployments. For the spacewalk, Malenchenko donned an Orlan spacesuit with the blue stripe. The duration of the spacewalk was 5 hours and 51 minutes. The spacewalk was delayed for about an hour due to a small leak between International Space Station modules. The spacewalk started from thePirsDocking Compartment Module at 15:37 GMT. The first task for Padalka and Malenchenko was to relocate the Strela-2 boom from thePirsmodule to the forward end of theZaryamodule. The relocation was needed sincePirsmodule was to be detached from the Space Station for the arrival of the new Multi-purpose Laboratory Module (MLM)Nauka, both of which occurred in 2021. The next task completed by Padalka and Malenchenko was to deploy a 21-inch diameter spherical satellite. The two cosmonauts also  retrieved five debris shields from thePirsModule, prior to installing them on theZvezdaModule. They also completed several get-ahead tasks (since they both opted not to take rests during the night passes) as the duo were about an hour ahead of the timeline. They retrieved an external experiment called Biorisk from thePirsModule for return to Earth, and  for added stability installed two structural support struts between thePirsModule and the EVA ladder. Padalka and Malenchenko then both ingressed thePirsModule, prior to closing the hatch and beginning the re-pressurisation procedure, to end a successful spacewalk.
