He logged over 6,000 flight hours in more than 30 different aircraft.[5]

NASA experience
Selected by NASA in June 1987, Allen became an astronaut in August 1988. His technical assignments have included: Astronaut Office representative for all Space Shuttle issues related to landing sites, landing and deceleration hardware, including improvements to nosewheel steering, brakes and tires, and drag chute design;Shuttle Avionics Integration Laboratory(SAIL), which oversees, checks, and verifies all Shuttle flight control software and avionics programs; Technical Assistant to the Flight Crew Operations Director who is responsible for and manages all flight crew operations and support; lead of the Astronaut Support Personnel team which oversee Shuttle test, checkout, and preparation at the Kennedy Space Center; Special Assistant to the Director of theJohnson Space CenterinHouston, Texas; lead of a Functional Workforce Review at the Kennedy Space Center, Florida, to determine minimal workforce and management structure requirements which allow maximum budget reductions while safely continuing Shuttle Flight Operations; Director of Space Station Requirements at NASA Headquarters, responsible for theInternational Space Stationrequirements, policies, external communications and liaison withCongress, international partners, and industry.[6]A veteran of three space flights, Allen has logged over 900 hours in space. He was the pilot onSTS-46in 1992 andSTS-62in 1994, and was mission commander onSTS-75in 1996.[1]

Spaceflight experience
STS-46 was an 8-day mission aboard theSpace ShuttleAtlantiswhich featured the deployment of theEuropean Retrievable Carrier(EURECA), an ESA-sponsored free-flying science platform, and demonstrated theTethered Satellite System(TSS), a joint project between NASA and theItalian Space Agency. STS-46 launched July 31, 1992,[7]and landed at theKennedy Space Center,Florida, on August 8, 1992.[8]The flight completed 126 orbits covering 3.3 million miles in 191.3 hours.[9]
STS-62 was a 14-day mission aboard theSpace ShuttleColumbiawhich consisted of 5 crewmembers that conducted a broad range of science and technology experiments with Earth applications to materials processing, biotechnology, advanced technology, and environmental monitoring.[10]Principal payloads of the mission were the United States Microgravity Payload 2 (USMP-2)[11]and the Office of Aeronautics and Space Technology 2 (OAST-2) package.[11]STS-62 launched March 4, 1994,[12]and landed at the Kennedy Space Center, Florida, on March 18, 1994.[13]The flight completed 224 orbits covering 5.8 million miles in 335.3 hours.[10]
STS-75 was a 16-day mission aboard theSpace ShuttleColumbiawith principal payloads being the reflight of the Tethered Satellite System (TSS) and the third flight of the United States Microgravity Payload (USMP-3).[14]The TSS successfully demonstrated the ability of tethers to produce electricity. The TSS experiment produced a wealth of new information on the electrodynamics of tethers and plasma physics before the tether broke[15]at 19.7 km, just shy of the 20.7 km goal. The crew also worked around the clock performing combustion experiments and research related to USMP-3 microgravity investigations used to improve production of medicines, metal alloys, and semiconductors. STS-75 launched on February 22[16]and landed on March 9, 1996. The mission was completed in 252 orbits covering 6.5 million miles in 377 hours and 40 minutes.[14]
