Owen Kay Garriott(November 22, 1930 – April 15, 2019) was an Americanelectrical engineerandNASA astronaut, who spent 60 days aboard theSkylabspace stationin 1973 during theSkylab 3mission, and 10 days aboardSpacelab-1on aSpace Shuttlemission in 1983.
After serving in theUnited States Navy, Garriott was an engineering professor atStanford Universitybefore attending theUnited States Air ForcePilot Training Program and later joining NASA. After his NASA career, he worked for various aerospace companies, consulted on NASA-related committees, taught as an adjunct professor, and conducted research onmicrobesfound in extreme environments.

Early life
Owen Kay Garriott was born inEnid, Oklahoma, on November 22, 1930, to Owen (1909–1981) and Mary Catherine Garriott (néeMellick; 1912–1993).[1]: 58–59Owen's middle name was based on his mother's middle name.[1]: 59He was aBoy Scout(earning the rank ofStar Scout),[2]and graduated fromEnid High Schoolin 1948, where he served as senior class president and was voted "Most Likely To Succeed."[3]He received aBachelor of Sciencedegree inelectrical engineeringfrom theUniversity of Oklahomain 1953, where he was a member ofPhi Kappa Psifraternity. He was also the elected president of the senior class.[4]He later earnedMaster of ScienceandPh.D.degrees fromStanford Universityin electrical engineering in 1957 and 1960, respectively.[5]

Career

U.S. military
Garriott served aselectronicsofficer in theUnited States Navyfrom 1953 to 1956. From 1961 through 1965, he was anassistant professorandassociate professorof electrical engineering at Stanford University. He performed research and led graduate studies inionospheric physicsafter obtaining his doctorate, and authored or co-authored more than 45 scientific papers, chapters and one book, principally in areas of thephysical sciences.[6]
As a prerequisite of the era's scientist-astronaut training, he completed a one-yearUnited States Air Forcepilot training program in 1966, receiving qualification as pilot injet aircraft.[7]

NASA
In 1965, Garriott was among thesix scientist-astronautsselected byNASA.[8]His first spaceflight, theSkylab 3mission in July–September 1973, set arecord for durationof over 59 days, more than doubling the one of the spring'sSkylab 2, just to be soon beaten bySkylab 4. Extensive experiments were conducted of theSun, ofEarth resourcesand in variouslife sciencesrelating to human adaptation toweightlessness.[7]
Garriott's second space flight was aboardSTS-9(Spacelab-1) in November–December 1983, a multidisciplinary and international mission of 10 days aboardSpace ShuttleColumbia. Over 70 separate experiments in six different disciplines were conducted, primarily to demonstrate the suitability of Spacelab for research in all these areas. Garriott was also anExtra Classamateur radio operator holding call sign W5LFL. He operated the world's firstamateur radio stationin space and on December 1, 1983 made the first amateur radio contact from space using a Motorola handheld 2-meter radio. Amateur radio subsequently expanded into an important activity on dozens of shuttle flights, Space StationMirand theInternational Space Station, with scores of astronauts and cosmonauts participating.[7]
Between these missions, Garriott received a NASA fellowship in the Space Station Project Office. In this position, he worked closely with the external scientific communities and advised the project manager concerning the scientific suitability of thespace stationdesign.[7]
Garriott held the distinction of being the NASA astronaut with the earliest-obtainedPhD degree, having earned his PhD fromStanford Universityin 1960, two years beforeRobert A. Parkerfrom Caltech in 1962.

The Skylab "stowaway" prank
On September 10, 1973, controllers inHoustonwere startled to hear a woman's voice beaming down from Skylab. The voice startledcapsule communicator(CAPCOM)Robert Crippenby calling him by name, and then the woman explained: "The boys haven't had a home-cooked meal in so long I thought I'd bring one up." After several minutes in which she described forest fires seen from space and the beautiful sunrise, the woman said: "Oh oh. I have to cut off now. I think the boys are floating up here toward the command module and I'm not supposed to be talking to you." As Garriott later revealed, he had recorded his wife, Helen, before the launch, giving descriptions of multiple events that might occur during the mission.[9]

Post-NASA career
After leaving NASA in June 1986, Garriott consulted for various aerospace companies and served as a member of several NASA andNational Research CouncilCommittees.[7]
From January 1988 until May 1993, he wasvice presidentof space programs atTeledyne Brown Engineering. This division, which grew to over 1,000 people, providedpayloadintegration for all Spacelab projects at theMarshall Space Flight Centerand had a substantial role in the development of the U.S. laboratory for the International Space Station.[7]
Garriott devoted time to several charitable activities in his hometown, including the Enid Arts and Sciences Foundation of which he was a co-founder in 1992. Later, he accepted a position as adjunct professor in the Laboratory forStructural Biologyat theUniversity of Alabama in Huntsvilleand participated in research activities there involving new microbes he returned from extreme environments such as veryalkaline lakesand deep seahydrothermal vents.Hyperthermophileswere returned from several dives in Russian MIR submersibles to theRainbow Vent Fieldat a depth of 2,300 meters near theAzoresin the centralAtlantic Ocean. Other research activities included three trips toAntarcticafrom which 20 meteorites were returned for laboratory study. Garriott formed a501(c)(3)public philanthropic Garriott Family Foundation to finance the aforementioned adventure travel for himself, his wife and other members of his family.[7]

Personal life and death
Garriott married Helen Mary Walker, his high schoolsweetheart, in 1952.[1]: 61They had four children, includingRobert GarriottandRichard Garriott.[10][11][1]: 61After he divorced his first wife, Garriott married Evelyn L. Garriott, who had three children from a previous relationship.[1]: 520
His son Richard was launched as aspace touriston boardSoyuz TMA-13on October 12, 2008, the first American and the second person worldwide to follow a parent into space.[12]Owen Garriott was in mission control at theBaikonur CosmodromeinKazakhstanfor the launch and was in attendance when his son returned 12 days later.[13][14]
Garriott died on April 15, 2019, at his home inHuntsville, Alabama.[15]

Organizations
Garriott was a member of the following organizations:American Astronautical Society(fellow),American Institute of Aeronautics and Astronautics(associate fellow),Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers,[7]American Geophysical Union,American Association for the Advancement of Science,Association of Space Explorers(Board of Directors), Astronaut Scholarship Foundation (vice presidentandvice chairman).[7]

Awards and honors
Garriott received the following honors:National Science FoundationFellowship, 1960–1961; Honorary Doctorate of Science,Phillips University(Enid, Okla.), 1973;NASA Distinguished Service Medal, 1973;Fédération Aéronautique InternationaleV. M. KomarovDiploma for 1973;[16]theOctave Chanute Awardfor 1975;[17]and theNASA Space Flight Medal, 1983.[7]
The three Skylab astronaut crews were awarded the 1973Collier Trophy"For proving beyond question the value of man in future explorations of space and the production of data of benefit to all the people on Earth."[18][19]Gerald Carraccepted the 1975Dr. Robert H. Goddard Memorial TrophyfromPresident Ford, awarded to the Skylab astronauts.[20]
He was one of five Oklahoman astronauts inducted into theOklahoma Aviation and Space Hall of Famein 1980,[21]theUnited States Astronaut Hall of Famein 1997,[22]the Oklahoma Military Hall of Fame in 2000,[23]and the Enid Public Schools Hall of Fame in 2001.[7]
Garriott was presented anHonorary Doctorateof Science from Phillips University in 1973.[24]
A street named after him in Enid, Oklahoma, serves as one of the city's main thoroughfares. It is part ofU.S. Route 412.[25]

Books
Garriott was co-author, with fellow astronautJoseph Kerwinand writerDavid Hitt, ofHomesteading Space, a history of the Skylab program, published in 2008.[26]He was co-author ofIntroduction to Ionospheric PhysicswithHenry Rishbeth. Garriott was also a contributor to the bookNASA's Scientist-Astronautsby David Shayler andColin Burgess. Garriott wrote the foreword to the book.[1]: xv–xvi
