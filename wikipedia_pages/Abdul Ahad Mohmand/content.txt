Abdul Ahad Momand(Pashto:عبدالاحد مومند; born 1959) is anAfghan-Germanand formerAfghan Air Forceaviatorwho became the first, and currently only,Afghanastronautto journey to outer space.[4]He became one ofSoyuz TM-6crew members and spent nine days aboard theMirspace stationin 1988 as anInterkosmosresearch cosmonaut.[5]
Momand holds many records as an Afghan astronaut. He became the first person to take theQuranto space and recite it there.[6]When he spoke to his mother on the phone from space,Pashtobecame the fourth language to be officially spoken in space.[7]He became the first Afghan citizen and thefourth Muslim to visit outer space, afterSultan bin Salman Al Saud,Muhammed Faris, andMusa Manarov.

Early years
Momand was born sometime in 1959[a][8]inSardeh Band,Andar District, within theGhazni ProvinceofAfghanistan.[9]He belongs to theMomandtribe of thePashtunethnic group. After completing his education inHabibia High School, he entered theKabul Polytechnic Universityin 1976 at the age of 17, and graduated two years later before being drafted into the military in 1978.[7]

Career
Momand was then sent to theSoviet Unionfor pilot training. There, he studied at theKrasnodar Higher Military Aviation School of Pilotsand the Kiev Higher Air Force Engineering School before returning to Afghanistan in 1981, where he rose through the ranks, becoming a chief navigator atBagram Air Base.[7]He returned to the Soviet Union in 1984 to train at theGagarin Air Force Academy. Not long after graduating in 1987, he was selected as a cosmonaut candidate for theInterkosmosproject. The other cosmonaut candidate sent for training wasMohammad Dawran, an AfghanMiG-21pilot with the rank of Colonel. While Dawran had more political connections than Momand and held a higher military rank (since Momand was a captain at the time), Dawran'sappendicitiswas the deciding factor in Momand being chosen for the primary crew. Dawran then became part of the backup crew for Momand's mission.[10]
Along with CommanderVladimir Lyakhovand Flight EngineerValery Polyakov, Momand was part of theSoyuz TM-6three-man crew, which launched at 04:23GMT29 August 1988.[11]Momand's inclusion in the mission was a significant symbol during theSoviet–Afghan War.[12]
During his nine days stay on the Mir space station in 1988, Momand took photographs of his country, participated in astrophysical, medical and biological experiments. He also spoke to then-PresidentMohammad Najibullahof Afghanistan, and brewed Afghan tea for the crew.[13]Momand was also recorded reciting theQuranin space at the request of theAfghan Governmentwhile his legs were held by another crew member outside of the shot to prevent him from floating away.[14]
Lyakhov and Momand returned to Earth aboardSoyuz TM-5. The 6 September planned landing ofSoyuz TM-5was delayed because of mechanical complications on the Mir.Radio Moscowreassured listeners that Lyakhov and Momand were fine and in touch with Mission Control. However, their sanitation facilities were on board the jettisonedorbital moduleand consequently they soiled themselves during the delay. A recording, colloquially called the der’mo tape, was played of them laughing about this. A day later, the retro-fire was successful, and at 00:50 GMT Soyuz TM-5 landed nearDzhezkazgan. During touchdown, there was no live radio coverage, but only livetelevisionpictures of Mission Control.[15]
As Momand returned toAfghanistan, he was greeted by a large crowd that threw flowers at him, as theMujahideenfired a barrage of rockets towards the city ofKabul. The city was the site of 25 separate rocket attacks in a single day, resulting in 35 dead and 165 injured.[16]
Momand was awarded the title ofHero of the Soviet Unionon 7 September 1988 as well as theHero of the Democratic Republic of Afghanistanand theOrder of Lenin.[2]
During his flight to space, his mother was extremely distraught over the safety of her son. President Najibullah called Momand's mother into the President's office and arranged an audio/video conference between Momand and her. By this event,Pashtobecame the fourth language spoken in space.[11][7]On his return, he was made deputy minister of civil aviation.[17]
Momand was in India sorting out a complaint regardingAriana Airlinesduring the collapse of Najibullah's government in 1992. Momand decided to emigrate toGermany, and applied for asylum there, becoming a German citizen via naturalisation in 2003.[18]He worked in the printing service and is now an accountant residing inOstfildernnearStuttgart.[18][19]He received theRussianMedal "For Merit in Space Exploration"in 2010. He returned to Afghanistan in 2013, at the request of then-PresidentHamid Karzai, for the occasion of the twenty-fifth anniversary of his space mission[17]as shown in theBBC Persiandocumentary “Kabul to the Galaxy” (Persian: کابل تا کهکشان,Kābul tā Kahkešān).[20]

Personal life
Momand is married to Zulfara and has 2 daughters and a son.[14]Momand is fluent in 4 languages,Pashto,Persian,RussianandGerman.[21]
