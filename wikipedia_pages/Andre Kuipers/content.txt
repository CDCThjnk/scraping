Kuipers is the first Dutch astronaut to return to space. On 5 August 2009, Dutch minister of economic affairsMaria van der Hoeven, announced Kuipers was selected as an astronaut forInternational Space Station(ISS) Expeditions30and31. He was launched to space on 21 December 2011 and returned toEarthon 1 July 2012.[1][2]

Personal life and education
André Kuipers was born on 5 October 1958 inAmsterdam, in the Netherlands. He graduated from high school in Amsterdam in 1977, and received a medical degree from theUniversity of Amsterdamin 1987. He is married and has three daughters and a son.[3]
When interviewed about his youth, Kuipers stated that he dreamed of becoming an astronaut ever since he was a teenager.[4][5]His dreams became reality when he was selected to theEuropean Astronaut Corpsin 1998.

Space flight experience
Kuipers has flown two space missions: first the DELTA mission in 2004. In May 2009, he served as the backup of Belgian astronautFrank de Winne, who later became theExpedition 21commander, during the later part of his six-month mission. On 21 December 2011, Kuipers was launched for his second spaceflight PromISSe on Expedition 30 and Expedition 31. He returned to Earth on 1 July 2012.[6]

DELTA Mission
Using theSoyuz TMA-4, mounted atop aSoyuz-FGrocket, Kuipers and his fellow cosmonautsGennady Padalka(Russia) andMichael Fincke(USA) rocketed towards the ISS in the early morning of 19 April 2004. The spacecraft flawlessly docked to the ISS two days later.
As part of his DELTA mission, Kuipers conducted 21 experiments[7]in orbit on a wide range of subjects:physiology,biology,microbiology, medicine,technological development,physicsandEarth observation.[8]One of the experiments in the field of technological development was related to the development of more energy-efficient lighting. The so-calledArges project, of which Kuipers' experiment formed a part, was commissioned byEindhoven University of TechnologyandPhilips Electronics. Maybe the best-known experiment involved plant growth:Seeds in Space. Kuipers cooperated with primary school children in the Netherlands to compare results of plant growth from orbit with those from Earth.
Padalka and Fincke remained on board theISSfor six months, as theExpedition 9crew.
Kuipers returned to Earth nearly eleven days after launch on 30 April, joined by departing ISS crew membersAlexander Kaleri(Russia) andMichael Foale(US), who thereby ended their six-month stay on board the ISS.

Expedition 30/31
On 26 November 2008, Dutch minister of economic affairsMaria van der Hoevenpushed for a second, six-month mission for Kuipers in 2011.[9]In the same speech, she said she would support the ISS project with an extra "few" million euros.[9]
After a call with ESA director generalJean-Jacques Dordainon 4 August 2009, Maria van der Hoeven confirmed on 5 August that Kuipers would be making a second space flight, starting in December 2011.[10]Kuipers was the first astronaut to be selected for ISS Expeditions30and31. Kuipers launched on 21 December 2011 on theSoyuz TMA-03Mflight with his two fellow crew members CosmonautOleg Kononenkofrom the Russian Space AgencyRoscosmos, andDon PettitfromNASA. They arrived at the station on 23 December 2011 when their Soyuz docked to theRassvetmodule on the Russian side.  They returned to Earth on 1 July 2012, when their Soyuz TMA-03M touched down in the steppe of Kazakhstan.[11]
