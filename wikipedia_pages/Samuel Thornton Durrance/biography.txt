- Samuel Thornton Durrance (September 17, 1943 – May 5, 2023) was an American scientist who flew aboard two NASA Space Shuttle missions as a payload specialist .
- Durrance was born September 17, 1943, in Tallahassee, Florida , but grew up in Tampa, Florida . He attended Wilson Junior High and graduated from Plant High School in 1961, lettering in American football for three years and playing both defense and offense. He received a Bachelor of Science degree and a Master of Science degree in physics (with honors), at California State University, Los Angeles (Cal State LA), 1972 and 1974, respectively, and a Doctor of Philosophy degree in astro-geophysics at the University of Colorado at Boulder , 1980. In 2000, he was awarded a Honorary Doctor of Science from the University of Colorado at Boulder along with eight other astronaut alums.
- Durrance was a principal research scientist in the Department of Physics and Astronomy at Johns Hopkins University , Baltimore, Maryland. He was a co-investigator for the Hopkins Ultraviolet Telescope , one of the instruments of the Astro Observatory .
- Beginning in 2001, he was the executive director of the Florida Space Research Institute which was located at the NASA Kennedy Space Center .
- Durrance resided in Melbourne, Florida , and was a professor of physics and space sciences at Florida Institute of Technology .
- Durrance was a member of the American Astronomical Society , American Geophysical Union , International Astronomical Union , Association of Space Explorers , Planetary Society , and Phi Kappa Phi .
- Durrance had been involved in the flight hardware development, optical and mechanical design, construction , and integration of the Hopkins Ultraviolet Telescope and the Astro Observatory, and had conducted research and directed graduate students at the Johns Hopkins University He had designed and built spectrometers , detectors, and imaging systems, and made numerous spacecraft and ground-based astronomical observations. He conceived and directed a program at Johns Hopkins University to develop adaptive-optics instrumentation for ground-based astronomy. He led the team that designed and constructed the Adaptive Optics Coronagraph , which led to the discovery of the first cool brown dwarf orbiting a nearby star. He was also a co-discoverer of changes in the planet-forming disk surrounding the star beta Pictoris .
- In March 1986, Durrance's first mission was for STS-61-E . It was canceled after the Challenger disaster . Durrance logged over 615 hours in space as a payload specialist and member of the crew of Space Shuttle Columbia for the STS-35 /Astro-1 and Space Shuttle Endeavour for the STS-67 /Astro-2 missions.
- Durrance was employed by the Florida Institute of Technology in Melbourne, Florida, serving as a professor in the Department of Aerospace, Physics and Space Sciences.
- Durrance was diagnosed with Alzheimer's disease in 2021. He died at a hospice facility in Viera, Florida , on May 5, 2023, of complications from a fall, after battling dementia and Parkinson's disease . He was 79.
