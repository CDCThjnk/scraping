During Expedition 44 Yui robotically supported the arrival of JAXAs HTV-5 uncrewed resupply spacecraft in August 2015 and was part of a rare "direct handover" period on board the ISS where nine crew members were present on board the station following the arrival of Soyuz TMA-18M and before the departure of Soyuz TMA-16M , this handover was carried out in order to allow Kornenko and Kelly to remain on board the ISS for a full year .
- Yui remained on board the ISS alongside Lindgren, Kononenko, Korneninko and Kelly following the departure of Soyuz TMA-16M , after which the five transferred over to Expedition 45, they were joined by Russian cosmonaut Sergey Volkov who brought the crew up to six members.
