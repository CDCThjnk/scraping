Kalpana Chawla(March 17, 1962 – February 1, 2003) was anIndian-Americanastronaut andaerospace engineerwho was the first woman of Indian origin to fly to space. Chawla expressed an interest in aerospace engineering from an early age and took engineering classes at Dayal Singh College andPunjab Engineering Collegein India. She then traveled to the United States, where she earned her MSc and PhD, becoming a naturalized United States citizen in the early 1990s.
She first flew on theSpace ShuttleColumbiain 1997 as a mission specialist androbotic armoperator aboardSTS-87. Her role in the flight caused some controversy due to the failed deployment of the Shuttle-Pointed Autonomous Research Tool for Astronomy ("Spartan") module.[2]Chawla's second flight was in 2003 onSTS-107, the final flight ofColumbia. She was one of the seven crew members who died in theSpace ShuttleColumbiadisasterwhen the spacecraft disintegrated during its reentry intoEarth'satmosphereon February 1, 2003.
Chawla was posthumously awarded theCongressional Space Medal of Honor, theNASA Space Flight Medal, and theNASA Distinguished Service Medal. Several buildings, spacecraft, and extraterrestrial landmarks have been named in her honor.

Early life and education
Kalpana Chawla was born on March 17, 1962, inKarnal, Haryana, India, to Banarsi Lal Chawla, the owner of a tire manufacturing plant, and Sanjogta Kharbanda.[a][6]Her family werePunjabi Hindusoriginally fromGujranwalainWest Punjab, who traveled toEast Punjabas refugees during thePartition of Indiain 1947.[7]She had three siblings: sisters Sunita and Dipa, and brother Sanjay.[5]As a child, she expressed interest in aerospace engineering, but was dismissed by her father, who said that "only guys want to do [aerospace engineering]" and instead recommended that she become a doctor or teacher.[8]She attended theTagore Baal Niketan Senior Secondary Schoolin Karnal, graduating in 1976 "near the top of her class".[9]
Chawla took basic engineering courses at Dayal Singh College in Karnal.[10]She then attended the aeronautical engineering school at Punjab Engineering College inChandigarh, where she studied the principles of theoretical aerodynamics.[11]She was one of four women in the program and the first female student to take aerospace engineering classes at the college.[12]Some professors discouraged her from studying aerospace engineering, claiming that it was not suitable for women and suggesting electrical engineering instead. She graduated from the college in 1982 with a Bachelor of Engineering (BEng).[13]
Because she could not take further specialized aerospace engineering courses in India, Chawla traveled to the United States to continue her education in 1982, again facing opposition from her father.[9]She earned her MSc from theUniversity of Texas at Arlington(UTA) in 1984, with her thesisOptimization of cross flow fan housing for airplane wing installation.[b][15]She met her husband, pilot Jean-Pierre Harrison, while at UTA, and the two married on December 2, 1983.[12]
Chawla then attended theUniversity of Colorado Boulder(CU Boulder), where she first decided that she wanted to join the space program, receiving her PhD in 1988 with the thesisComputation of dynamics and control of unsteady vortical flows.[16]While attending CU Boulder, Chawla began taking flying lessons at theBoulder Municipal Airport, eventually receiving commercial pilot's licenses permitting her to fly various types of land and seaplanes, as well as gliders.[17]She later became certified as a flight instructor for single-engine airplanes andflight instruments.[18]

Career

Before NASA
In 1988, Chawla began working at NASA'sAmes Research Center, where she initially conductedcomputational fluid dynamicsresearch onvertical and/or short take-off and landing(V/STOL) concepts. She subsequently studied how to use multiple computers to solve fluid flow problems, testing these methods by calculating powered lift effects.[19]Sometime in the early 1990s, she became a naturalized United States citizen, a requirement for becoming a NASA astronaut.[c]
Chawla joined Overset Methods, Inc, a non-profit research organization based inLos Altos, California, as both a research scientist and the organization's vice president in 1993.[21]Her work focused on simulating problems involving multiple moving objects.[22]While in Los Altos, she joined the West Valley Flying Club at thePalo Alto Airportand learnedBharatanatyamfrom the Abhinaya Dance Company inSan Jose.[23]In December 1994, she returned to NASA to undergo training as a candidate astronaut at theJohnson Space Centeras part ofNASA Astronaut Group 15, eventually being assigned to the EVA and robotics division of theNASA Astronaut Corpsin 1995.[24]

First space mission
Chawla's first space mission began on November 19, 1997, as part of the six-astronaut crew that flew on theSpace ShuttleColumbiaflightSTS-87. She served as a mission specialist and a backup flight engineer during takeoff. When STS-87 launched, Chawla became the first woman of Indian origin to go into space. Indian Prime MinisterInder Kumar Gujralcalled her to congratulate her on her flight, expressing pride on behalf of the people of India and lauding Chawla for inspiring Indian women and children.[12]
During the mission, Chawla was assigned to deploy one of the shuttle's payloads: the Spartan research module. Due to a power surge that damaged its control system, Spartan failed to perform its expected pirouette movement. Chawla attempted to grapple the satellite with the shuttle's robotic arm but did not receive a clear signal on the control panel showing it was secured, causing her to move the arm back. In the process, she accidentally hit the Spartan, causing it to spin at two degrees per second. Fellow astronautKevin R. Kregelalso attempted to grapple the payload by matching its spin with the shuttle's, but this movement was ultimately aborted. In the end, a spacewalk was required to retrieve the payload.[25]
Chawla also supervised and performed experiments as part of the fourth United States Microgravity Payload mission (USMP-4). As part of this mission, Chawla studied how to mix liquids evenly to create specific metal combinations that could be used in future computer chips. Using Columbia's Middeck Glovebox, she worked withimmisciblesto understand the causes behind their separation.[26]
Some members of the press criticized Chawla for her handling of the Spartan payload, but Kregel refused to assign blame in an interview with theOrlando Sentinelstating that:
We'd be very foolish if we tried to second-guess or tried to figure out what the actual turn of events were without having all the information... We're six folks up here; we know what happened on our side, we'll get together with the folks on the ground and we'll put the whole story together and make sure it never happens again. Sure, we're always a bit disappointed if we don't get the full mission accomplished, but we did retrieve the satellite, and so the important thing is we're bringing Spartan back down to Earth, and it'll get to fly another day.[2]
NASA formed a team to investigate the deployment failure on December 4, 1997. The investigation initially attributed the failure to "crew error", but Chawla was ultimately exonerated, with the investigators citing insufficient training, errors in software interfaces, and poor communication withground controlas the causes of the incident.[27]In all, as part of the STS-87 mission, Chawla traveled 10.4 million miles in 252 orbits of the Earth, logging more than 376 hours (15 days and 16 hours) in space.[22]
After the mission, in January 1998, Chawla was given a technical assignment advising shuttle engineers on different aspects of payload development and the astronaut experience.[28]Soon after, she was selected to head the Astronaut Corps' Crew Systems and Habitability department.[29]

Second space mission and death
On July 27, 2000, Chawla was selected for her second flight as part of the crew of STS-107.[30]STS-107 was delayed 13 times over two years for a variety of reasons, including orbiter maintenance and the discovery of cracks in the shuttle engine flow liners on July 19, 2002. The mission finally launched on January 16, 2003.[31]As the mission's flight engineer, she provided assistance to pilotWilliam C. McCoolduring takeoff.[32]
STS-107 was a multidisciplinary scientific mission modeled after the previousSTS-90.[33]The crew was assigned to two teams working in shifts to ensure that experiments were conducted nonstop. Chawla worked on the Red Team alongside fellow astronautsIlan Ramon,Laurel Clark, andRick Husband.[34]She performed a variety of experiments while in orbit, researchingastrocultureas well as the properties ofcombustion,crystal growth,granular materials, andmist.[35]Overall, the crew of STS-107 performed over 80 experiments in various disciplines.[36]
As the flight engineer, Chawla was tasked, alongside mission specialist Clark, with assessing the shuttle's system beforereentryon February 1.[37]Columbia began reentry on 8:44 a.m. on February 1. At 8:54 a.m, four sensors on the shuttle's wing failed, and at 9:00 a.m, the shuttle began disintegrating in the sky above Texas, killing all seven crew members aboard.[38]In 2003, a report by theColumbiaAccident Investigation Board found that a piece ofinsulating foambroke off from the shuttle'sexternal tankduring liftoff, striking the left wing of theorbiter.[39]When theColumbiabegan reentry, hot gases entered the damaged wing, leading to the shuttle's destruction.[40]
NASA established a team nearHemphill, Texas, to search for the remains of the crew.[41]On February 4 or 5, NASA began transporting the recovered remains to the Armed Forces Institute of Pathology atDover Air Force Base.[d][42]By February 11, all crew members' remains had been recovered, including Chawla's. A memorial service was held in Hemphill that afternoon.[43]Her remains were ultimately cremated and scattered atZion National Park.[44]

Legacy
Chawla was the recipient of numerous posthumous honors. On February 3, 2003, it was announced that the girls' hostel at Punjab Engineering College, where Chawla obtained her BEng, would be named after her. A prize consisting of INR ₹25,000, a medal, and a certificate was also created to reward the top students in the aeronautical engineering department.[45]Also in February, Prime Minister of India,Atal Bihari Vajpayee, announced that the satellite "MetSat-1" would be renamed "Kalpana-1".[46]Then, in August, Asteroid51826 Kalpanachawlawas named after her, one of seven asteroids named after theColumbia's crew.[47]TheFlorida Institute of Technologynamed one of its residence buildings after Chawla in 2003 as part of "Columbia Village", which was dedicated to the sevenColumbiaastronauts.[48]Steve Morseof the bandDeep Purplereleased the song "Contact Lost" in 2003 in memory of theColumbiadisaster.[49]Chawla took three Deep Purple albums on STS-107, using their song "Space Truckin'" as a wakeup call.[50]One of their albums was found in the shuttle's wreckage.[51]
Seven peaks in theColumbia HillsonMarswere named after theColumbiaastronauts on February 2, 2004, with one of them being named after Chawla.[52]Two days later, on February 4, Chawla was posthumously awarded theCongressional Space Medal of Honorby PresidentGeorge W. Bush.[53]She was also awarded the NASA Space Flight Medal and the NASA Distinguished Service Medal.[22]In March, theGovernment of Karnatakainstituted the "Kalpana Chawla Award" to recognize young female scientists.[54]Then, in September, UTA, where Chawla obtained her MSc in 1984, opened "Kalpana Chawla Hall," also known as "KC Hall". Chawla's father was present for the hall's dedication.[55]The lunar crater "Chawla" was named after her in 2006.[56]The Kalpana Chawla Planetarium in Haryana was also dedicated to her in 2007.[57]NovelistPeter Davidnamed a shuttlecraft, theChawla, after her in his 2007Star Treknovel,Star Trek: The Next Generation: Before Dishonor.[58]In 2010, a memorial display was dedicated to Chawla in UTA'sNedderman Hall.[59]
In 2017, theKalpana Chawla Government Medical Collegewas established in Karnal.[60]Then, in 2020, she became the focus of the second season of theNational Geographicdocumentary seriesMega Iconsalongside musicianA. R. Rahman, actressDeepika Padukone, and industrialistRatan Tata.[61]Thefourteenth contracted Northrop Grumman Cygnus spacecraft mission, which was launched in October 2020 to deliver supplies to theInternational Space Station, was named the S.S.Kalpana Chawlain her honor.[62]A fictionalized version of Chawla appears in the 2023 movieA Million Miles Away, where she is played by actressSarayu Blue.[63]
