 - Soyuz 19(Apollo–Soyuz)
 - Soyuz 36/35
Valery Nikolaevich Kubasov(Russian:Вале́рий Никола́евич Куба́сов; 7 January 1935 – 19 February 2014) was a Soviet and Russiancosmonautwho flew on two missions in theSoyuz programmeas aflight engineer:Soyuz 6andSoyuz 19(theApollo–Soyuzmission), and commandedSoyuz 36in theIntercosmosprogramme. On 21 July 1975, theSoyuz 7K-TMmodule used for ASTP landed in Kazakhstan at 5:51 p.m. and Kubasov was the first to exit the craft. Kubasov performed the firstweldingexperiments in space,[1]along withGeorgy Shonin.
Kubasov was also involved in the development of theMirspace station. He retired from theRussian space programin November 1993 and was later deputy director ofRKK Energia.
Kubasov evaded death twice during his space career. He was part of the crew that was originally intended to flySoyuz 2, which was found to have the same faulty parachute sensor that resulted inVladimir Komarov's death onSoyuz 1and was later launched without a crew. Later, he was grounded for medical reasons before theSoyuz 11flight, which killed the crew when the capsule was accidentally depressurised by a faulty valve.

Early life
Kubasov was born 7 January 1935, inVyazniki, Vladimir Oblast,Ivanovo Industrial Oblast,RSFSR, nowVladimir Oblast,Russia. After finishing secondary school in 1952, he graduated from theMoscow Aviation Institutein 1958 as anaerospace engineerand reported to work at the bureau led bySergei Korolev.[2]Initially focusing on ballistic studies, Kubasov worked on the design of theVoskhod capsule.[2]He authored several studies on the calculation of spaceship trajectories, and acquired aMaster of Sciencedegree inEngineering.[3]
In May 1964, while working for Korolev, Kubasov became one of a handful of civilian candidates who passed preliminary medical screening for one of the SovietVoskhodmissions. Two years later, after some relaxation of the existing rules, Kubasov along withGeorgy GrechkoandVladislav Volkov, were officially accepted into the newly established civilian cosmonaut corps.

Cosmonaut
Kubasov's first space mission, the five-daySoyuz 6flight in October 1969, was unsuccessful due to technical issues as space vehicles never met up. During Soyuz 6 mission Kubasov andGeorgy Shoninperformed the firstweldingexperiment inspace. The Vulcan furnace required internal hatches between theorbitalanddescent modulesto be sealed, with the welding performed automatically, overseen by Kubasov.[4]Samples ofstainless steelandtitaniumwere welded together, then cut, after which the hatches were opened for Kubasov to perform a hand-held welding. However, in 1990 it became known that Vulcan's low-pressure compressed arc had inadvertently targeted a beam at the orbital module wall.[4]Upon opening the hatch, the cosmonauts discovered the damage and, fearing adepressurization, returned to the descent module.[4]
Following his first mission, Kubasov began training to fly aboard the world's firstspace station,Salyut 1, along with Georgy Shonin andPyotr Kolodin.
In 1971 Kubasov was almost launched aboard the ill-fatedSoyuz 11mission, he was among the prime crew alongsideAlexei Leonov. Medics from the Institute for Biomedical Problems in Moscow found aswellingon Kubasov's right lung.[4]Fearing the onset oftuberculosis, the entire Soyuz 11 prime crew was grounded and replaced by the backup:Georgy Dobrovolsky,Vladislav VolkovandViktor Patsayev. In his memoirTwo Sides of the MoonLeonov would later write: "It turned out later, that [Kubasov] was allergic to a chemical insecticide used to spray trees".[4]
The July, 1975,Apollo–Soyuz Test Projectbecame Kubasov's second space mission and he was a flight engineer on it. Kubasov spent several hours in theApollo commandand docking modules. During this project Kubasov told theU.S. PresidentGerald Fordin a TV linkup, that they got "good space food... some juice, some coffee and a lot of water".[3]
Kubasov's last spaceflight was aboardSoyuz 36in 1980. During this flight, the Soyuz transported the crew that includedBertalan Farkas, the firstHungarianastronaut. Kubasov retired as a cosmonaut on 13 November 1993.[3]

Death
Kubasov died inMoscowofnatural causeson 19 February 2014, at the age of 79.[5]He was survived by his wife Lyudmila Kurovskaya, daughter Ekaterina and son Dmitry.[6]
