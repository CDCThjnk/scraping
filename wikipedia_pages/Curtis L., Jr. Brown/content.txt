Curtis Lee "Curt" Brown Jr.(born March 11, 1956) is a formerNASAastronautand retiredUnited States Air Forcecolonel.[1]

Background
Colonel Brown was born March 11, 1956. He graduated from East Bladen High School inElizabethtown, North Carolinain 1974[2]and received aBachelor of Sciencedegree inelectrical engineeringfrom theUnited States Air Force Academyin 1978.[3]
He is a member of the United StatesAir Force Association, the United States Air Force Academy Association of Graduates, and theExperimental Aircraft Association.[1]

Military service
He was commissioned aSecond Lieutenantat theUnited States Air Force AcademyinColorado Springs, Colorado, in 1978, and completedUndergraduate Pilot TrainingatLaughlin Air Force BaseinDel Rio, Texas.[1]He graduated in July 1979 and was assigned to flyA-10aircraft atMyrtle Beach Air Force Base,South Carolina, arriving there in January 1980 after completing A-10 training atDavis-Monthan Air Force Base,Arizona. In March 1982, he was reassigned to Davis-Monthan AFB as an instructor pilot in the A-10.[1]
In January 1983, he attendedUSAF Fighter Weapons SchoolatNellis Air Force Base,Nevadaand returned to Davis-Monthan AFB as aninstructorin A-10 weapons and tactics.[1]In June 1985, he attendedUSAF Test Pilot SchoolatEdwards Air Force Base,California.[1]Upon graduation in June 1986, Brown was assigned toEglin Air Force Base,Florida, where he served as atest pilotin theA-10andF-16aircraft until his selection for the astronaut program.[1]
He has logged over 6,000 hours flight time in jet aircraft.[1]

NASA
Selected as an astronaut candidate by NASA in June 1987,[4]Brown completed a one-year training and evaluation program in August 1988, and is qualified for flight assignment as a pilot. Technical assignments have included: involvement in the upgrade of theShuttle Mission Simulator(SMS), development of the Flight Data File (FDF), lead of the astronaut launch support team responsible for crew ingress/strap-in prior to launch and crew egress after landing; monitored the refurbishment ofOV-102andOV-103during ground turnaround processing; lead spacecraft communicator (CAPCOM), Astronaut Office Lead of Shuttle Operations, and Deputy Director, Flight Crew Operations Directorate.[1]

Space flights
A veteran of six space flights, Brown has logged over 1,383 hours in space.[1]He was the pilot onSTS-47in 1992,[5]STS-66in 1994[6]andSTS-77in 1996,[7]and was spacecraft commander onSTS-85in 1997,[8]STS-95in 1998,[9]andSTS-103in 1999.[10]
Brown's first spaceflight wasSTS-47aboard theSpace ShuttleEndeavour.[5]The mission launched September 12, 1992 14:23 (UTC)[11]and was an eight-day cooperative mission between the United States and Japan focused onlife scienceandmaterials processingexperiments in space. After completing 126 orbits of Earth, the mission ended with theEndeavourlanding at theShuttle Landing Facilityin Florida, September 20, 1992 12:53 (UTC).[12]Mission duration was 190 hours, 30 minutes, 23 seconds.[13]
For Brown's second spaceflight,STS-66, he piloted theSpace ShuttleAtlantis. The mission lifted off fromLaunch Complex 39BNovember 3, 1994 16:59 (UTC).[14]was the Atmospheric Laboratory for Applications and Science 3 (ATLAS-3) mission.[14]ATLAS-3 was part of an ongoing program to determine the Earth's energy balance andatmosphericchange over an 11-year solar cycle. Following 175 orbits of the Earth, the 11-day mission ended with theAtlantislanding atEdwards Air Force Base, California, November 14, 1994 15:34 (UTC).[15]Mission duration was 262 hours and 34 minutes.[16]
Brown served as pilot for the third time duringSTS-77aboard theSpace ShuttleEndeavour.[7]Lift-off of the ten-day mission occurred May 19, 1996 10:30 (UTC).[17]The crew performed a record number of rendezvous sequences (one with a SPARTAN satellite and three with a deployed Satellite Test Unit) and approximately 21 hours offormation flyingin proximity of the satellites. During the flight the crew also conducted 12materials processing,fluid dynamics, andbiotechnologyexperiments in aSpacehabModule. STS-77 deployed and retrieved a SPARTAN satellite, which carried the Inflatable Antenna Experiment designed to test the concept of large, inflatable space structures. A small Satellite Test Unit was also deployed to test the concept of self-stabilization by usingaerodynamicforces andmagneticdamping. The mission was concluded in 160 Earth orbits, with a landing at the Shuttle Landing Facility May 29, 1996 11:10 (UTC)[18]after traveling 4.1 million miles in 240 hours and 39 minutes.[19]
Brown's first command and fourth spaceflight wasSTS-85aboard theSpace ShuttleDiscovery. The shuttle lifted off fromLaunch Complex 39AAugust 7, 1997 14:41 (UTC)[20]on a 12-day mission during which the crew deployed and retrieved the CRISTA-SPAS payload, operated the Japanese Manipulator Flight Demonstration (MFD) robotic arm, studied changes in the Earth's atmosphere and tested technology destined for use on the futureInternational Space Station. The mission was accomplished in 189 Earth orbits, and concluded with a landing at the Shuttle Landing Facility August 19, 1997 11:08 (UTC)[21]after traveling 4.7 million miles in 284 hours and 27 minutes.[22]
Brown flew in space for the fifth time duringSTS-95as commander aboard theSpace ShuttleDiscovery. Lifting off from Launch Complex 39B October 29, 1998 19:19 (UTC),[23]STS-95was a 9-day mission during which the crew supported a variety of research payloads including deployment of the Spartan solar-observing spacecraft, theHubble Space TelescopeOrbital Systems Test Platform, and investigations on space flight and the aging process. The mission was accomplished in 134 Earth orbits, touching down at the Shuttle Landing Facility November 7, 1998 17:04 (UTC)[24]after traveling 3.6 million miles in 213 hours and 44 minutes.[25]The mission was highly publicized for the return of 77-year-old SenatorJohn Glenn's return to space after 38 years.[9]This flight made Brown the only astronaut besidesTom Staffordto have commanded a member of theMercury 7on a mission.
Brown's sixth and final spaceflight wasSTS-103as commander aboard theSpace ShuttleDiscovery. Lifting off from Launch Complex 39A December 20, 1999 00:50 (UTC),[26]STS-103 was an 8-day mission during which the crew successfully installed new instruments and upgraded systems on the Hubble Space Telescope (HST). Enhancing HST scientific capabilities required three space walks. The STS-103 mission was accomplished in 120 Earth orbits, touching down at the Shuttle Landing Facility December 28, 1999 00:01 (UTC)[27]after traveling 3.2 million miles in 191 hours and 11 minutes.[28]

Post-NASA career
Brown left NASA in May 2000 and became an airline pilot forAmerican Airlines[29]and laterSun Country Airlines.[30]He was inducted into theAstronaut Hall of Famein April 2013.[30]He is currently the chairman of the board of the directors of the Astronaut Scholarship Foundation.[31]
