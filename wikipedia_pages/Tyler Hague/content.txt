Tyler Nicklaus "Nick" Hague(born 24 September 1975) is aUnited States Space Forcebrigadier general andNASAastronaut, selected as part of the2013 astronaut class.[1][2]Hague's first spaceflight was aboardSoyuz MS-10on 11 October 2018, which was aborted shortly after launch. His second mission,Soyuz MS-12, successfully launched on 14 March 2019, where he joinedExpedition 59/60aboard theInternational Space Station(ISS) as a flight engineer.[3]Hague later commandedSpaceX Crew-9, transporting the crew ofExpedition 72to the ISS. The mission also included astronautsSunita WilliamsandButch Wilmore, both of whom had previously participated in theBoeing Crew Flight Testin June 2024. The crew returned to Earth on 18 March 2025.[4]

Education
Hague was born inBelleville, Kansasin 1975.  He attended Peabody-Burns Elementary School, inPeabody, Kansas, while his father was the principal ofPeabody-Burns High Schoolfrom 1982 to 1989.[5]In 1994, Nick graduated fromHoxie High SchoolinHoxie, Kansas, while his father was superintendent of the school district.[6]
In 1998, he completed aBSinAerospace Engineeringfrom theUnited States Air Force Academyand continued to study and graduate with aMSinAerospace EngineeringfromMassachusetts Institute of Technologyin 2000.

U.S. Air Force and Space Force career
Hague joined theU.S. Air Forceand was commissioned assecond lieutenantin May 1998. He was assigned to theKirtland Air Force Base,Albuquerque, New Mexico in August 2000, working on advanced spacecraft technologies.
In 2003, Hague attended theUnited States Air Force Test Pilot School, inEdwards Air Force Base,California. Following graduation in 2004, he was assigned to the416th Flight Test Squadronand tested theF-16,F-15andT-38aircraft.
Hague was deployed in Iraq for five months in 2004, supportingOperation Iraqi Freedom, and conducting experimental airborne reconnaissance.
In 2006, Hague started teaching courses in the Department of Astronautics faculty at theUnited States Air Force Academy, Colorado. He has taught courses in introductory astronautics, linear control system analysis and design.
In 2009, Hague received a fellowship for the Air Force Fellows program in Washington, D.C.
From 2012 until 2013 Hague worked in the Department of Defense as Deputy Chief of theJoint Improvised Explosive Device Defeat Organization.
Hague was promoted tocolonelin 2016.[7]His transfer to theU.S. Space Forcewas approved in December 2020.[8]In 2019, Hague served as the Space Force's director of Test and Evaluation atthe Pentagon.[9]
Although ColonelMichael S. Hopkinsbecame the first Space Force guardian in space when he transferred from the Air Force to the Space Force while onboard theInternational Space Station, Hague is the first guardian to launch into space.[10]
He was nominated for promotion to the rank of Brigadier General on 13 June 2025,[11]and this promotion was confirmed by the Senate on 29 June 2025.[12]

NASA career
Hague was selected byNASAas part ofAstronaut Group 21and completed training in July 2015, making him available for future missions.[2]
Hague was the first astronaut of the 2013 NASA astronaut class to be selected for a mission; he was slated to be aflight engineerforExpedition 57/58.

Soyuz MS-10 (aborted)
On 11 October 2018, Hague andAleksey Ovchininlaunched aboard theSoyuz MS-10spacecraft, en route to theInternational Space Station. However, during the ascent, one of the rocket's side boosters collided with the core stage at an altitude of approximately 50 kilometers (31 miles), causing an explosion. In response, the spacecraft automatically activated itslaunch escape system, pulling the crew away from the failing rocket and reaching anapogeeof 93 km (58 mi).[13][14][6]
Although the crew was safe, the spacecraft was forced into aballistic descent, during which they experienced forces of six to seven times Earth's gravity. Despite the intense descent, the crew landed safely 19 minutes and 41 seconds after liftoff, approximately 20 km (12 mi) east ofJezkazgan,Kazakhstanand about 402 km (250 mi) downrange from the launch site.[15]A search and rescue team quickly confirmed that both astronauts were in good health.[16][17]
The failed launch led to the temporary grounding of all crewed Soyuz missions. An investigation revealed that a manufacturing error in the rocket's side booster, specifically a damaged joint, prevented proper separation during flight.[18][19]
Though the spacecraft did not cross theKármán lineat 100 km (62 mi), the USAF defines the boundary of space at 80 km (50 mi), technically qualifying Hague for theUnited States Astronaut Badge. Instead, Hague was awarded a custom NASA Astronaut Pin made of tin, as opposed to the gold pin typically given to astronauts who have flown in space.[20][21]

Expedition 59/60
Hague launched successfully to theInternational Space Station(ISS) on 14 March 2019, aboardSoyuz MS-12, alongside Ovchinin and fellow NASA astronautChristina Koch. The trio joined CommanderOleg Kononenkoand Flight EngineersDavid Saint-JacquesandAnne McClainonExpedition 59.[3]After the departure of Kononenko, Saint-Jacques, and McClain in July 2019, Ovchinin, Hague, and Koch transitioned toExpedition 60, with Ovchinin taking command of the station. The crew would return to Earth in early October 2019.[22]
It was under consideration for Hague to stay on the ISS after the landing of Soyuz MS-12, transferring toSoyuz MS-15in order to return with a cosmonaut from theMohammed bin Rashid Space Centreof theUnited Arab Emirates. If this plan had proceeded, Hague would have spent over 14 months aboard the ISS, a mission comparable in length toValeri Polyakov'sSoyuz TM-18/Soyuz TM-20mission to theMirspace station, which lasted 437 days, 17 hours, and 58 minutes— the longest single spaceflight in history. However, in a February 2019 interview, Hague confirmed that his mission would last 204 days, and the extended stay was no longer an option.[23]
On 22 March 2019, Hague and fellow NASA astronautAnne McClainconducted their firstspacewalk, lasting 6 hours and 39 minutes. During the EVA, they installed adapter plates whileDextreswapped the ISS batteries. They also removed debris from theUnitymodule in preparation for the arrival ofCygnus NG-11in April, stowed tools for the repair of the flex hose rotary coupler, and secured tiebacks on the solar array blanket boxes.[24]
On 29 March 2019, Hague performed his second EVA with Koch. The spacewalk was originally intended to be the first all-female EVA, however, space suit issues led to Hague being assigned. The EVA lasted 6 hours and 45 minutes.[25][26]
On 21 August 2019, Hague performed his third EVA alongside NASA astronautAndrew R. Morgan. The EVA, which lasted 6 hours and 32 minutes, involved installing a newInternational Docking Adapteron theHarmonymodule. During this EVA, Hague wore theArtemis programlogo on his suit.[27]

Expedition 72
Hague served as the commander ofSpaceX Crew-9flight to the International Space Station, transporting the crew ofExpedition 72.
Initially, Hague was slated to be the pilot of Crew-9. However, following changes in mission plans, he was appointed commander. The mission was originally planned to launch four crew members: NASA astronautZena Cardmanas commander, Hague as pilot,Stephanie Wilsonas mission specialist, andRoscosmoscosmonautAleksandr Gorbunovas mission specialist.[28]However, due to technical issues with theBoeing Starliner, which returned to Earth uncrewed, Crew-9 was adjusted to accommodate two open seats for returningBoeing Crew Flight TestastronautsBarry E. WilmoreandSunita Williams.[29]
Following the change, NASA appointed Hague as the commander of Crew-9 due to his prior spaceflight experience.[30][31]To accommodate these changes, Hague and Gorbunov (who would now occupy the pilot's seat) worked with NASA, SpaceX, Cardman, and Wilson to modify the mission's tasks to identify how Hague could assume many of the tasks typically divided between the commander and pilot, and determine which tasks could be assigned to Gorbunov.[32]
Hague performed his fourth EVA on 16 January 2025, alongside Expedition 72 commanderSunita Williams. During the six-hour spacewalk, the pair replaced a rate gyro assembly, installed patches on theNeutron Star Interior Composition Explorer(NICER) X-ray telescope, replaced a reflector on theInternational Docking AdapteronHarmony'szenith side, and conducted checks for future maintenance work on theAlpha Magnetic Spectrometer.[33]During this EVA, Hague wore theSpace Force Deltaon his arm, along with the Space Force motto "Semper Supra" (Latinfor'always above').

Now we have had three weeks of training and it's been awesome to watch the full team come together, to watch the SpaceX team, to watch the NASA team surge and just roll your sleeves up and figure out, okay, how do we need to change things? And it's, you know, we've had previously flown Dragon crew members in the astronaut office that have helped support us. Zena and Stephanie have been integral to this effort and have pointed out and helped us come up with some great ways to understand what we can and can't do given the training that Alex has cause he's there, he's been through this training for two years. And so, there are things that he is extremely capable of doing that I would do as a pilot. And so we want to leverage those. But there's also a lot of things that he hasn't been trained on. And so we identify where those limitations are and then, and then I figure out what I need to do in order to cover down on all of that.
