His fellow crew included CommanderJohn W. Young,mission specialists,Owen GarriottandRobert Parker, andpayload specialists,Byron LichtenbergandUlf Merbold. This was the largest crew to fly aboard a singlespacecraft, the first internationalShuttlecrew and the first to carry payload specialists.
The crew conducted more than seventymulti-disciplinaryscientific and technical investigations in the fields oflife sciences,atmospheric physicsand earth observations,astronomyandsolar physics,space plasmaphysics, andmaterials processing. After ten days ofSpacelabhardware verification and around-the-clock scientific operations,Columbiaand its laboratory cargo (the heaviest payload to be returned to Earth in the shuttle's cargo bay) returned to land on thedry lake bedat Edwards AFB.
Shaw first served as Shuttle Commander onSTS-61-BAtlantis.[3]The mission launched at night on November 26 and returned on December 3, 1985.
The crew included Commander Shaw; PilotBryan O'Connor; mission specialistsMary Cleave,Jerry Ross, andWoody Spring; as well as payload specialistsRodolfo Neri Vela(Mexico), andCharles Walker(McDonnell Douglas).
During the mission the crew deployed the communicationssatellites, conducted two six-hourspacewalksto demonstratespace stationconstruction techniques with theEASE/ACCESSexperiments, operated the Continuous Flow Electrophoresis (CRFES) experiment forMcDonnell Douglasand a Getaway Special (GAS) container forTelesat, conducted several Mexican payload specialist experiments for theMexican Governmentand tested the Orbiter Experiments Digital Autopilot (OEX DAP). This was the heaviest payload weight carried to orbit by the shuttle to date. After completing 108orbitsof the Earth in 165 hours, Shaw landedAtlantison Runway 22 at Edwards AFB.
Brewster Shaw told the NASAoral historianfor STS-61-B that he installed apadlockon the hatch control because he was "particularly concerned" that the MexicanRodolfo Neri Velacould "flip out" during the mission.[7]Shaw noted that he did not think that Neri Vela noticed the padlock at the time, but that other members of the crew did.[7]
Shaw was the commander ofSTS-28Columbia[3](August 8–13, 1989). The mission included PilotDick Richardsand three mission specialists:Jim Adamson,Dave LeestmaandMark Brown.
