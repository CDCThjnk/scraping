His father, Aleksandr Borisovich Shatalov (1890–1970), was arailway engineerand an early recipient of theHero of Socialist Labour.

He helped to build the "Road of Life" across the frozenLake Ladoga. This was the only route into the city during the bitter winters.[3]Shatalov went back to Petropavlovsk, where his family left for evacuation. In 1943, Shatalov graduated from the seven-year school in Petropavlovsk.[4]

In early 1945, Shatalov graduated from the 6th Voronezh Air Force Special School, which he was evacuated toKaraganda, followed byLipetsk.

Shatalov was a master on multiple aircraft, mostly theYakandMiGaircraft. The total flight time by the time of enrollment in the cosmonaut corps was more than 2,500 hours.

Cosmonaut career
Shatalov had dreams of flying even higher, but was worried he may be too old to train as a cosmonaut. When Yuri Gargarin became the first man in space in April 1961, he was a full seven years younger. However, in 1962 Shatalov was asked to nominate the five best pilots under his command for consideration as cosmonauts, and put his own name forward at the top of the list. He passed the medical exam and then the interview in Moscow, which included Gargarin himself on the panel.[3]By order of the Commander-in-Chief of the Air Force No.14 on 10 January 1963, Shatalov was enrolled in theCosmonaut Training Centeras a listener-cosmonaut. From January 1963 to January 1965, Shatalov underwent general space training. He studied the systems, design and operating rules of the spacecraftVostok 3A,Voskhod,Voskhod 2, andSoyuz. On 13 January 1965, after passing the exams, Shatalov was qualified as an Air Force cosmonaut. On 23 January 1965, 
Shatalov was appointed cosmonaut of the 2nd Detachment (Military Space Programs).
Shatalov was in space three times. He made his first flight on 14 January 1969, on theSoyuz-4spacecraft. It was the first to carry out manual rendezvous and docking withSoyuz-5. With his participation, for the first time in the world, an experimental space station was created and the transition through open space of cosmonautsAleksei YeliseyevandYevgeny Khrunovfrom the Soyuz-5 spacecraft to the Soyuz-4 was carried out.[5][6]There was no internal connecting corridor between the two craft, and so the crew had to step into space using handrails on the craft in order to carry out the transition. For his part in this feat, he was made a Hero of the Soviet Union and awarded The Order of Lenin.[3]

Later life
From 25 June 1971, Shatalov served as Assistant to the Air Force Commander-in-Chief for Space Flight Preparation and Support (Deputy Air Force Commander for Space). From 1971 to 1991, Shatalov was a member of the State Commission on Manned Space Flights.
