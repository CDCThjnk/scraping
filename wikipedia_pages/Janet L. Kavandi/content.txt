Janet Lynn Kavandi, a native ofCarthage, Missouri, (born July 17, 1959) is an Americanscientistand aNASAastronaut. She is a veteran of threeSpace Shuttlemissions, served as NASA'sdeputy chief of the Astronaut Office,[1]and was the center director at the NASAGlenn Research Centerin Cleveland, Ohio, from March 2016 until her retirement from NASA in September 2019.[2]She was inducted into theUnited States Astronaut Hall of Famein 2019.
Kavandi is president ofSierra Space.[3][4]

Education
Kavandi graduatedvaledictorianin 1977 fromCarthage Senior High School-Carthage, Missouri. She went on to earn degrees in chemistry fromMissouri Southern State College(bachelor's, 1980), theMissouri University of Science and Technology(masters, 1982), and theUniversity of Washington(doctorate, 1990).[5]

Career
Following graduation in 1982, Kavandi accepted a position atEagle-Picher Industriesin Joplin, Missouri, as an engineer in new battery development for defense applications. In 1984, she accepted a position as an engineer in the Power Systems Technology Department ofBoeing Defense, Space & Securityin Seattle, Washington. She served as the lead engineer of secondary power for theShort Range Attack Missile II, and principal technical staff representative involved in the design and development of thermal batteries forSea Lanceand theLightweight Exo-Atmospheric Projectile. Other programs she supported include Space Station, Lunar and Mars Base studies,Inertial Upper Stage, Advanced Orbital Transfer Vehicle,Getaway Specials,Air Launched Cruise Missile,Minuteman, andPeacekeeper. In 1986, while still working for Boeing, she was accepted into graduate school at theUniversity of Washington, where she began working toward her doctorate in analytical chemistry. Her doctoral dissertation involved the development of apressure-indicating coatingthat uses oxygen quenching of porphyrinphotoluminescenceto provide continuous surface pressure maps of aerodynamic test models in wind tunnels. Her work on pressure indicating paints has resulted in twopatents.[5]

NASA career
Kavandi was selected as an astronaut candidate by NASA in December 1994 and reported to the Johnson Space Center in March 1995. Following an initial year of training, she was assigned to the Payloads and Habitability Branch, where she supported payload integration for the International Space Station. Kavandi served as a mission specialist on STS-91 (June 2–12, 1998), the 9th and finalShuttle-Mirdocking mission, concluding the joint U.S./Russian Phase 1 program. Following the mission, she worked as a CAPCOM (spacecraft communicator) in NASA's Mission Control Center. On her second mission, she served aboard STS-99 (February 11–22, 2000), the Shuttle Radar Topography Mission, which mapped more than 47 million miles of the Earth's land surface to provide data for a highly accurate three-dimensional topographical map.
Kavandi subsequently worked in the Robotics Branch, where she trained on both the shuttle and space station robotic manipulator systems. On her most recent mission, she served aboard STS-104/ISS Assembly Flight 7A (July 12–24, 2001) on the tenth mission to the International Space Station. The shuttle crew installed the joint airlock "Quest" and conducted joint operations with theExpedition 2crew. Kavandi had trained in theNeutral Buoyancy Laboratoryfor spacewalking, but she did not take a spacewalk during STS-104.
Following her last mission, Kavandi again served as lead for the Payloads and Habitability Branch, then as the branch chief for the International Space Station (ISS). She was responsible for the training, operations, safety, and habitability of crews on board the ISS, as well as the hardware and software development and design reviews. She was also responsible for the scientific payloads that the ISS crews operate on-orbit and for coordination between international partners for visiting vehicles and associated operations. In 2005, Kavandi accepted a position asdeputy chief of the Astronaut Officeand served in that position until February 2008. Following that assignment, she became deputy director, flight crew operations, and then director, flight crew operationsJohnson Space Center.
A three-flight veteran, Kavandi has logged over 33 days in space, traveling over 13.1 million miles in 535 Earth orbits.
In March 2016, Kavandi succeeded Jim Free as the center director at the NASAGlenn Research Centerin Cleveland, Ohio.
In September 2019, she retired from NASA[1]and started atSierra Nevada Corporation.
