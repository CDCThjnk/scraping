Gregory Thomas Linteris(born October 4, 1957 inEnglewood, New Jersey) is an American scientist who flew as apayload specialiston twoNASASpace Shuttlemissions in 1997.

Education
Linteris grew up inDemarest, New Jersey, where he attendedNorthern Valley Regional High School at Demarest.[1]He received a bachelor of science degree inchemical engineeringfromPrinceton Universityin 1979 and a master of science degree from the design division of themechanical engineeringdepartment atStanford Universityin 1984; he was awarded a doctorate in mechanical andaerospace engineeringfrom Princeton in 1990 after completing a doctoral dissertation titled "Trace radical species detection in a turbulent chemical kinetic flow reactor using a 180⁰ laser induced fluorescence probe"[2]supervised by Fred Dryer. Linteris is a member of theAmerican Institute of Aeronautics and Astronautics, theAmerican Physical Society, theCombustion InstituteandSigma XiHe has over 100 publications in the areas ofcombustion,chemical kinetics,spectroscopy, andheat transfer.

Spaceflight experience
Linteris was a payload specialist onSTS-83(April 4–8, 1997) andSTS-94(July 1–17, 1997) and logged over 471 hours in space. STS-83, the Microgravity Science Laboratory (MSL-1)Spacelabmission, was cut short because of problems with one of theSpace Shuttle'sthreefuel cellpower generation units. STS-94 was a re-flight of the Microgravity Science Laboratory (MSL-1) Spacelab mission, and focused on materials andcombustion scienceresearch inmicrogravity.

Current position
During his spaceflight time and currently, Linteris is a staff scientist in the Fire Research Division of the Engineering Laboratory at theNational Institute of Standards and TechnologyinGaithersburg, Maryland.
