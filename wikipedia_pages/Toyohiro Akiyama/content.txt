 - Kyoko Akiyama​​(m.1970;div.1995)​
Toyohiro Akiyama(秋山 豊寛,Akiyama Toyohiro; born 22 July 1942)is a retired Japanese TVjournalistand professor atKyoto University of Art and Design. In December 1990, he spent seven days aboard theMirspace station.[4]He became the first person ofJapanesenationality to fly in space,[5]and his space mission was the second spaceflight to be commercially sponsored and funded.[4]Akiyama was also the first civilian to fly aboard a commercial space flight and the first journalist to report from outer space.[1][2]

Education and career
Akiyama attended and earned hisbachelor's degreeat theInternational Christian Universitylocated inMitaka, Tokyo. He then joined theTokyo Broadcasting System(TBS) as a journalist in 1966. He worked for theBBC World Servicefrom 1967–1971 before becoming a correspondent for the TBS Division of Foreign News. From 1984 to 1988, he served as TBS chief correspondent inWashington D.C.[4][5]

Space training
On 17 August 1989, Akiyama was selected for a commercial Soviet-Japanese flight. The flight was sponsored by the TBS Corporation to celebrate its fortieth anniversary.[6]The amount that the corporation paid for the flight of its employee differs significantly from one source to another (US$28 million,[7]US$25 million,[8]5 billion yen or US$37 million[9]). Akiyama started training at theYuri Gagarin Cosmonaut Training Centerin October 1989.[citation needed]

Spaceflight
TBS wanted to send the first Japanese person to space in order to boost their TV ratings.[3]163 TBS employees applied for the opportunity to fly to space. Eventually, Akiyama and camerawoman Ryoko Kikuchi were selected as the two final candidates. When Kikuchi developed a case ofappendicitisa week before launch, Akiyama was selected for cosmonaut training and he was the primary crew member, with no backup in place.[2]Akiyama began cosmonaut training in August 1989 in a deal between TBS and theSoviet Union.[4]The commercialization of space flight was evident by theSoyuz TM-11covered with advertising of TBS and other Japanese companies.[10]
Akiyama's mission marked the first flight of a person of Japanese nationality in space as well as the first commercially sponsored and funded spaceflight of an individual in history.[4][5][11]Akiyama also became the first journalist to give live reports from space.[2]After successfully completing aResearch Cosmonauttraining course at theYuri Gagarin Cosmonaut Training Centerin present-day Russia, Akiyama launched aboard theSoyuz TM-11mission to the Mir space station on 2 December 1990 along with mission commanderViktor Afanasyevand flight engineerMusa Manarov.
Akiyama was not a trained astronaut, scientist nor engineer.[3]During his time aboard Mir, Akiyama gave live reports each day documenting life aboard the station, but his apparent discomfort led to him being described as the first "antiheroin space".[3]He described his struggles such asspace sicknessand craving for cigarettes:[3]During training, he quit smoking cigarettes, having previously smoked four packs a day. Before liftoff, when asked what he looked forward to most upon his return to Earth, he said "I can't wait to have a smoke".[10]His fellow cosmonauts later reported, in regards to hisnausea, that they "hadn't ever seen a man vomit that much."[12]
Initially, the TBS TV viewership was high, but by midweek, it declined to slightly above normal.[3]Various reports have cited a flight cost paid by TBS as betweenUS$12 millionandUS$37 million. The company reportedly lostUS$7.4 millionon the deal.[2][13][14]Akiyama eventually returned to Earth just over a week later aboardSoyuz TM-10along withGennadi ManakovandGennadi Strekalovon 10 December. While onboard the space station, Akiyama made nightly live broadcasts.[3]

Later career
Akiyama returned to TBS after completing his spaceflight and became deputy director of the TBS News Division. He retired from TBS in 1995, because he disagreed with the active commercialization of television.[4][5]
In April 1991, he shot a film, with a group of Japanese journalists, about the state of theAral SeainKazakhstan.[15]
From January 1996, he engaged in organic farming with rice and mushrooms in theAbukuma mountainsin the townTakine, nearTamura, Fukushima,Fukushima Prefecture.[16][17]He also wrote books and gave lectures focusing on environmental issues.[17]In March 2011, he was personally affected by theFukushima disasterand was forced to abandon his farm.[18]
On 1 November 2011, he became a professor of agriculture at the Faculty of Arts,Kyoto University of Art and Design.[17][19]

Personal life
Akiyama was married to Kyoko Akiyama, and the couple had a son and a daughter.[3]He left his family in Tokyo to go farm.[19]They divorced in 1995.
