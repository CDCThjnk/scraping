Sergey Valeryevich Prokopyev(Russian:Серге́й Вале́рьевич Проко́пьев; born 19 February 1975) is a Russian cosmonaut. On June 6, 2018, he launched on his first flight into space aboardSoyuz MS-09and spent 197 days in space as aflight engineeronExpedition 56/57. On September 21, 2022, he launched aboardSoyuz MS-22and returned onboardSoyuz MS-23on September 27, 2023.

Cosmonaut career
In October 2010 Prokopyev was selected as a cosmonaut byRoscosmos, he began cosmonaut training February 2011, he graduated and gained the qualification of "test cosmonaut" in August 2012.[1]
Following his graduation he was part of the specialization and improvement group for the ISSRussian Orbital SegmentandSoyuz TMA-Mspacecraft, he held this position until June 2015 when he was assigned to a backup crew.
He trained as backup flight engineer forSoyuz TMA-18Mand ISS EP-18, training for a short-duration eight day stay on the ISS that was eventually flown byKazCosmoscosmonautAidyn Aimbetov.[2]Unlike most backup assignments, his assignment to TMA-18M did not lead into a later prime crew assignment, therefore following the launch of TMA-18M 2 September 2016 Prokopyev did not rotated onto a prime crew immediately.

Expedition 56/57
Prokopyev was originally meant to be Soyuz commander onSoyuz MS-08and flight engineer on ISSExpedition 55/56although due to Russian budget cutbacks reducing the number of crew members on the ISS Russian segment he was removed from the flight and instead was assigned as backup Soyuz commanderSoyuz MS-07and flight engineer/ISS commander forExpedition 54/55.[3]Following the launch of Expedition 54/55 he was assigned as prime crew flight engineer forExpedition 56/57alongsideGermanAlexander Gerst, who would serve as ISS commander for Expedition 57, and NASA astronautJeanette Epps, who would later be replaced by astronautSerena Aunon-Chancellor.
The trio launched onSoyuz MS-09from theBaikonur Cosmodromeon 6 June 2018 and spent approximately two days free flying inLow Earth orbitbefore the rendezvoused and docked to the ISS on 8 June, officially joined the Expedition 56 alongside American astronautsAndrew FeustelandRichard Arnoldas well as Russian cosmonautOleg Artemyev.[4]He performed his firstSpacewalkalongside Artemyev on 15 August, the two spent 7 hours and 46 minutes working outside the station where they installed a Roscosmos-DLRexperiment for observing animal migration, called ICARUS onto the outside of the station and manually deployed fourCubeSatinto orbit.[5]On 29 August an air leak was observed inside the station, this was later discovered to be caused by a hole aboard Soyuz MS-09, Prokopyev's spacecraft.[6]
Following the departure of Soyuz MS-08 on 4 October 2018, Prokopyev, Gerst and Aunon-Chancellor transferred over to Expedition 57, they were scheduled to be joined by Russian cosmonautAleksey Ovchininand American astronautNick Hagueon 11 October, although the flight was aborted during launch cancelling their arrival. In order to avoid de-crewing the space station, the landing of MS-09 was delayed from 11 December to 20 December, while the launch ofSoyuz MS-11was advanced from 20 December to 3 December, giving the two spacecraft and their six crew members a 17 day hand-over period. Prokopyev and his two crew mates worked together as a crew of three until 3 December 2018, with the arrival of Soyuz MS-11 carrying Russian cosmonautOleg Kononenko,CSAastronautDavid Saint-Jacquesand NASA astronautAnne McClain.[7]During his final days on the ISS on 11 December 2018, he and Kononenko performed a spacewalk to inspect the hole on Soyuz MS-09, they took images and applied a thermal blanket to the damaged area on the Soyuz's "orbital module", towards the end of the excursion the two also retrieved some science experiments from the outside of the station.[8]
He, Gerst, and Aunon-Chancellor returned to Earth on 20 December 2018, ending Prokopyev's first spaceflight after 196 days in space.[9]

Expedition 67/68/69
Prokopyev launched for his second journey to space on 21 September 2022 aboardSoyuz MS-22to theInternational Space Station.[10]He was the ISS commander with Russian cosmonautDmitry Petelinand NASA astronautFrancisco Rubio.[11]Prokopyev was part ofExpedition 67/68/69. His second mission was planned to last around 6 months with a return to Earth in early 2023. However, damage to the spacecraft extended the mission, and Prokopyev returned to Earth on 27 September 2023 withSoyuz MS-23after spending a year in space.[12]

Personal life
Prokopyev is married to Ekaterina Prokopyeva (née Negreyeva), who gave birth to their daughter, Anna, on 27 August 1997 and son, Timofei, on 23 February 2010.[1]
