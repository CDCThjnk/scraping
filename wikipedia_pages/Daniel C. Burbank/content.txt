In 1987, he went through flight training and became an instructor pilot, serving at various Coast Guard stations atCoast Guard Air Station Elizabeth City,Coast Guard Air Station Cape Cod, andCoast Guard Air Station Sitka.[2]He has a master's degree in aeronautical science fromEmbry-Riddle Aeronautical University.[3]

NASA career
Selected byNASAin April 1996, Burbank reported to theJohnson Space Centerin August 1996. After completing two years of training and evaluation, Burbank worked technical issues for the Astronaut Office Operations Planning Branch, and theInternational Space Station(ISS) Branch, and served as CAPCOM (spacecraft communicator) for both Space Shuttle and ISS missions. He was also a member of the Space Shuttle Cockpit Avionics Upgrade design team. Twice flown, he served as a mission specialist on STS-106 and STS-115 logging over 23 days in space, and 7 hours and 11 minutes of EVA time. From January 2007 to December 2009, Burbank served as a professor of engineering at theU.S. Coast Guard Academy, where he taught astronomy, aerodynamics, and statics & engineering design. Burbank was assigned to ISSExpedition 29andExpedition 30aboard ISS beginning September 2011.[4]

Spaceflight experience
STS-106Atlantis(September 8–20, 2000). During the 12-day mission, the crew successfully prepared the ISS for the arrival of the first permanent crew. The five astronauts and twocosmonautsdelivered more than 6,600 pounds of supplies and installed batteries, power converters, oxygen generation equipment and a treadmill on the ISS. Aspace walkwas performed to connect power and data cables between the newly arrived Service Module and the ISS.[5]
STS-115Atlantis(September 9–21, 2006) successfully restarted assembly of the ISS. During the 12-day mission, the crew delivered and installed the massive P3/P4 truss, and two sets of solar arrays that provide one quarter of the station's electrical power. The crew also performed unprecedented robotics activity using the Shuttle and ISS robotic arms. Burbank made a seven-hour extravehicular activity (EVA), a.k.a. a "spacewalk," that completed P3/P4 truss installation, activated the solar alpha rotary joint and enabled the solar arrays to be deployed.[6][7]
Expedition 29was launched to the ISS along with Russian cosmonautsAnton Shkaplerov,Anatoli Ivanishinand Burbank on November 13, 2011, arriving at the station on November 16, 2011 viaSoyuz TMA-22.[8]This expedition spent 66 days in space.
