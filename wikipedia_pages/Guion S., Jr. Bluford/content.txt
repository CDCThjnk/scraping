Personal life
Born inPhiladelphia, Bluford graduated fromOverbrook High Schoolin 1960. He received aBachelor of Sciencedegree inaerospace engineeringfromPennsylvania State Universityin 1964, aMaster of Sciencedegree in Aerospace Engineering from theAir Force Institute of Technology(AFIT) in 1974, aDoctor of Philosophydegree in Aerospace Engineering with a minor inLaserPhysics, again from AFIT, in 1978, and aMaster of Business Administrationdegree from theUniversity of Houston–Clear Lakein 1987.[4]He has also attended theWharton School of Businessof theUniversity of Pennsylvania.[5]
His hobbies includereading,swimming,jogging,racquetball,handball,scuba divingandgolf.[6]He married Linda Tull in 1964 and has two sons.[7]

Air Force career
Bluford attended pilot training atWilliams Air Force Base, and received hispilot wingson January 19 for the Aeromechanics Division and as branch chief of the Laboratory's Aerodynamics and Airframe Branch. He has written and presented several scientific papers in computationalfluid dynamics.[6]
He has logged over 5,200 hours of jet flight time in theT-33,T-37,T-38,F-4C,U-2/TR-1, andF-5A/Baircraft, including 1,300 hours as a T-38 instructor pilot.  He also has anFAAcommercial pilot license.[6]

NASA career
Bluford was selected to become aNASAastronaut in January 1978 as a part ofNASA astronaut group 8.[8]He was one of several astronauts recruited byNichelle Nicholsas part of a NASA effort to increase the number of minority and female astronauts.[9]They trained for a year and were officially designated as astronauts in August 1979.[6][10]His technical assignments have included working with Space Station operations, theRemote Manipulator System(RMS),Spacelabsystems and experiments,Space Shuttlesystems, payload safety issues and verifying flight software in theShuttle Avionics Integration Laboratory(SAIL) and in the Flight Systems Laboratory (FSL). Bluford was a mission specialist onSTS-8,STS-61-A,STS-39, andSTS-53.[11]
Bluford's first mission wasSTS-8, which launched fromKennedy Space Center, Florida, on August 30, 1983. This was the third flight for the OrbiterChallengerand the first mission with a night launch and night landing. During the mission, the STS-8 crew deployed theIndian National Satellite(INSAT-1B);[12]tested the Canadian-built robotic arm (the Shuttle Remote Manipulator System (SRMS) orCanadarm) with the Payload Flight Test Article (PFTA); operated the Continuous Flow Electrophoresis System (CFES) with live cell samples; conducted medical measurements to understand bio-physiological effects of space flight; and activated four "Getaway Special" canisters. STS-8 completed 98 orbits of the Earth in 145 hours before landing atEdwards Air Force Base,California, on September 5, 1983.[6]
Bluford then served on the crew ofSTS-61-A, the German D-1Spacelabmission, which launched from Kennedy Space Center on October 30, 1985. This mission was the first to carry eight crew members, the largest crew to fly in space, and included three European payload specialists. This was the first dedicated Spacelab mission under the direction of the German Aerospace Research Establishment (DFVLR) and the first U.S. mission in which payload control was transferred to a foreign country (German Space Operations Center,Oberpfaffenhofen, Germany). During the mission, the Global Low Orbiting Message Relay Satellite (GLOMR) was deployed from a "Getaway Special" (GAS) container, and 76 experiments were performed in Spacelab in such fields as fluid physics, materials processing, life sciences, and navigation. After completing 111 orbits of the Earth in 169 hours,Challengerlanded at Edwards Air Force Base on November 6, 1985.[6]
Bluford also served on the crew ofSTS-39, which launched from Kennedy Space Center on April 28, 1991, aboard the OrbiterDiscovery. The crew gatheredaurora, Earth-limb,celestial, and Shuttle environment data with the AFP-675 payload. This payload consisted of the Cryogenic Infrared Radiance Instrumentation for Shuttle (CIRRIS-1A) experiment, Far Ultraviolet Camera experiment (FAR UV), the Uniformly Redundant Array (URA), the Quadrupole Ion Neutral Mass Spectrometer (QINMS), and the Horizon Ultraviolet Program (HUP) experiment. The crew also deployed and retrieved the SPAS-II which carried the Infrared Background Signature Survey (IBSS) experiment. The crew also operated the Space Test Payload-1 (STP-1) and deployed a classified payload from the Multi-Purpose Experiment Canister (MPEC). After completing 134 orbits of the Earth and 199 hours in space,Discoverylanded at the Kennedy Space Center on May 6, 1991.[6]
Bluford's last mission wasSTS-53, which launched from Kennedy Space Center on December 2, 1992. The crew of five deployed the classifiedDepartment of Defensepayload DOD-1 and then performed several Military-Man-in-Space and NASA experiments. After completing 115 orbits of the Earth in 175 hours,Discoverylanded at Edwards Air Force Base on December 9, 1992.[6]
With the completion of his fourth flight, Bluford has logged over 688 hours in space.[6]
Bluford, anEagle Scout, was designated as the emissary to return theChallengerflagto Boy Scout Troop 514 ofMonument, Colorado, in December 1986. On December 18 of that year, he presented the flag to the troop in a special ceremony atFalcon Air Force Base.[13]

Bluford left NASA and retired from the USAF in July 1993 to take the post ofVice President/General Manager, Engineering  Division of NYMA,Greenbelt, Maryland. In May 1997, he became Vice President of the Aerospace Sector of Federal Data Corporation and in October 2000, he became the Vice President of Microgravity R&D and Operations for theNorthrop GrummanCorporation. He retired from Northrop Grumman in September 2002 to become thePresidentof Aerospace Technology, an engineering consulting organization inCleveland, Ohio.[6]
Bluford was inducted into theInternational Space Hall of Famein 1997,[11]theUnited States Astronaut Hall of Famein 2010,[14]and theNational Aviation Hall of Famein 2019.[15]
