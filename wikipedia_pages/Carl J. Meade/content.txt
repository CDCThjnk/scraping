He currently works forNorthrop Grumman Integrated Systemsas an engineering manager on theCrew Exploration Vehicleproject.

Experience
Prior to entering active duty in theUnited States Air Force, Meade was a Hughes Fellow at the California Institute of Technology and an electronics design engineer atHughes Aircraft CompanyinCulver City, California. He entered the U.S. Air Force atLaughlin Air Force Base,Texas, where he was a distinguished graduate ofUndergraduate Pilot Training. In 1977, Meade was assigned to the 363rd Tactical Reconnaissance Wing atShaw Air Force Base,South Carolina, where he flew theRF-4C. He was then selected as a member of theUSAF Test Pilot SchoolClass 80B.[3]
Upon graduation he received the Liethen-Tittle Award as the Outstanding Test Pilot and was assigned to the 6510th Test Wing atEdwards Air Force Base,California. In 1985, he was reassigned to the USAF Test Pilot School as a test pilot instructor in the F-4,A-7 Corsair II,A-37, and various gliders, teaching performance, stability/control, departure/spins, and radar flight test techniques. He was also the departure/spin lead instructor and avionics systems test training aircraft program manager.[4]
He has logged over 4,800 hours of jet time in 27 different aircraft.[4]

NASA experience
Selected byNASAin June 1985,[5]Meade became anastronautin July 1986. He has held a variety of technical assignments including verification testing of flight software in the Shuttle Avionics Integration Laboratory (SAIL), crew escape flight tests,Orbiterground egress tests and launch support duties, both at theKennedy Space Centerand at theVandenberg Launch Site. Prior toSTS-38and afterSTS-50, Meade was the Astronaut Office representative to the Solid Rocket Booster Program and the Space Shuttle Main Engine Program at the Marshall Space Flight Center. He also served as a spacecraft communicator (CAPCOM) in Mission Control and the lead astronaut for Rendezvous and Docking Operations during the two years following STS-50.
A veteran of three space flights, Meade has logged over 712 hours in space. He served as a mission specialist on STS-38 in 1990, STS-50 in 1992, andSTS-64in 1994.
STS-38launched at night from theKennedy Space Center,Florida, on November 15, 1990. Meade conductedDepartment of Defenseoperations[6]during this five-day flight which concluded after 80 orbits of the Earth in 117 hours, 54 minutes, 28 seconds. In the first Shuttle recovery in Florida since 1985,[7]Space ShuttleAtlantisand her five-man crew landed back at the Kennedy Space Center on November 20, 1990.[8]
STS-50, carrying the first United States Microgravity Laboratory (USML), launched from the Kennedy Space Center, Florida, on June 25, 1992.[9]USML is a series ofSpacelabflights dedicated to basic scientific research in the fields offluid physics, combustion science, solid state physics, andbiotechnology. This flight was also the first to utilize the Extended Duration Orbiter capabilities of the newly modified OrbiterColumbia. Mission duration was 331 hours, 30 minutes, 4 seconds. After 221 orbits of theEarth, the crew ofColumbialanded at the Kennedy Space Center on July 9, 1992, thus ending the longest flight in the history of the Space Shuttle Program.[10]
Most recently, Meade flew onSTS-64(September 9–20, 1994) aboard the Space ShuttleDiscovery. The mission highlight occurred when Meade performed the first untethered spacewalk in 10 years.[11]The objective was to flight test a self-rescue jetpack. Meade logged 6.9 hours outsideDiscoveryand 3.6 hours piloting the jetpack. Other activities included the first use oflasersfor environmental research, deployment and retrieval of a solar science satellite, and the performance of plume characterization studies of the reaction control thruster exhaust. Mission duration was 10 days, 22 hours, 51 minutes.
Meade has served as the Deputy Division Chief of the Crew and Thermal Systems Division and as the Chief of the Flight Support Branch of the Astronaut Office. In March 1996, Meade left NASA and the military to join the LockheedSkunk Worksas the Deputy Project Manager for theX-33vehicle.[12]
