Personal life
Soichi Noguchi was born in 1965 inYokohama, Japan. He considersChigasaki, Japan, to be his hometown. He holds flight instructor certificate as CFII and MEI. Noguchi was aBoy Scout.[10][11][12]His hobbies include jogging, basketball, skiing and camping.[13]

Education
Noguchi graduated from Chigasaki-Hokuryo High School (Chigasaki, Kanagawa) in 1984, and then studied at theUniversity of Tokyo, earning aB.S.degree in 1989 and anM.S.degree in 1991, both inAeronautical Engineering. Later on, he furthermore obtained aPh.D.degree in Advanced Interdisciplinary Studies in 2020, also from the University of Tokyo.[14][15][16]

Engineering career
After graduation, Noguchi worked forIshikawajima-Harima Heavy Industries, assigned to theresearch and developmentdepartment of their Aero-Engine and Space Operations division. He worked on aerodynamic design of commercial engines.[14]

Astronaut career
Noguchi was selected as an astronaut candidate by theNational Space Development Agency of Japan(now part ofJAXA) in June 1996. In August 1996, he reported to NASA'sJohnson Space Centerfor NASAastronaut training. Noguchi qualified as amission specialistafter two years, and received training on Russian space systems atGagarin Cosmonaut Training Centerin 1998. He was assigned to technical support for theJapanese Experiment Moduleof theInternational Space Station.
In 2013, Noguchi served as cavenaut into theESA CAVES[17]training inSardinia, alongsideDavid Saint-Jaques,Andreas Mogensen,Nikolai Tikhonov,Andrew FeustelandMichael Fincke.

STS-114
In April 2001 Noguchi was assigned to the crew ofSTS-114as a mission specialist, which at that point the flight was targeting launch to the ISS in 2003 aboardSpace Shuttle Atlantis, he was assigned to the crew alongside NASA astronautsEileen Collins(Commander),James Kelly(Pilot) andStephen Robinson(Mission Specialist), they were also scheduled to be joined by theExpedition 7crew, who would remain aboard the ISS, replacing theExpedition 6crew who would land aboard STS-114.[18]
Noguchi and the crew trained for this flight until February 2003, whenSTS-107, the flight immediately prior to STS-114,broke up while returning to Earth, destroying theSpace ShuttleColumbiaand killing the seven astronauts on board; following this all shuttle flights were delayed. Since STS-114 was scheduled to be the next mission to fly following STS-107, its designation and crew were assigned as the "return to flight" mission, their flight remained relatively similar although new tasked needed to verify the changes made to the shuttle and the shuttle flight plan were added to the flight. Also, the delay in shuttle flights meant the launch ofExpedition 7was moved from STS-114 toSoyuz TMA-2, leaving three more seats to be filled on STS-114, NASA astronautsCharles Camarda,Wendy LawrenceandAndrew Thomaswere added to the crew to take their place.[18]
STS-114 launched aboardSpace ShuttleDiscoveryon 26 July 2005, over two years since theColumbiadisaster.[19]The shuttle docked to the ISS two days later, the crew joined theExpedition 11crew consisting of Russian CommanderSergei Krikalevand American Flight EngineerJohn Phillips. Prior to docking to the station,Discoveryand its crew performed the first-everrendezvous pitch maneuver, which allowed the two crew members aboard the station to photograph and observe the shuttle's heat shield, allowing them to discover any possible damage on the spacecraft'sheat shield. The maneuver was added following theColumbiadisaster, which was caused by damage to the heat shield.[20]
During his first stay aboard the station, Noguchi performed threespacewalks, all three alongside Robinson. On the first excursion outside, the two tested new techniques for repairing damaged tiles on the shuttle's heat shield, while the second and third spacewalks were both dedicated to upgrading and maintaining the space station, replacing a Control Movement Gyro which had suffered a mechanical failure in 2002 and installing anExternal stowage platformwhich was brought up aboard STS-114.[21]Over the course of the three EVAs Noguchi spent 20 hours and 5 minutes outside the station.[1]
Noguchi and his crew mates returned to Earth on 9 August 2005, carrying over 7,055 pounds of equipment and trash down from the station inside of aMulti-Purpose Logistics Module, which had been used to bring up supplies to the station two weeks earlier.Discovery's landing at theKennedy Space Centerwrapped up a 13-day, 21 hour, 32 minute and 48 second spaceflight.[22]

Expedition 22/23
Following STS-114, Noguchi was assigned as a backup ISS Flight Engineer for JAXA astronautKoichi Wakata, who became the first Japanese astronaut to live long duration aboard the space station.[23]Following his assignment as a backup for Wakata, JAXA assigned Noguchi to the crew of ISSExpedition 22/23alongside Russian cosmonautOleg Kotovand NASA astronautTimothy Creamer.[24]
Noguchi and his two crew mates launched on 21 December 2009 aboardSoyuz TMA-17, he became the first JAXA astronaut and second Japanese citizen (followingTokyo Broadcasting SystemreporterToyohiro Akiyama) to fly on a Soyuz spacecraft, the trio spent two days in free flight, before docking to the ISS and joining the Expedition 22 crew, joining American CommanderJeff Williamsand Russian flight engineerMaksim Surayev.[25]
During Expedition 22, the crew were visited bySpace ShuttleEndeavourduring its penultimate flight,STS-130, which delivered theNode 3module and theCupolato the station. During this flight Noguchi was also in space with his former STS-114 crewmate Stephen Robinson, who was mission specialist on STS-130.[26]Soyuz TMA-16returned to Earth on 18 March 2010, carrying Surayev and Williams and officially ending Expedition 22, following which Noguchi, Kotov, and Creamer transferred to Expedition 23, with Kotov taking command of the station.[27]Shortly after they were joined bySoyuz TMA-18, carrying Russian cosmonautsAleksandr SkvortsovandMikhail Kornienkoas well as American astronautTracy Caldwell Dyson.[28]
Expedition 23 was visited by two Space Shuttle missions,STS-131andSTS-132. STS-131 delivered new supplies to the ISS aboard Space ShuttleDiscovery, the flight also carried JAXA mission specialistNaoko Yamazaki, who joined Noguchi on the station for a short while, marking the first time two Japanese citizens were in space at the same time.[29]Space ShuttleAtlantislaunched to the station carrying the RussianRassvetmodule to the station towards the end of Expedition 23.[30]
Noguchi, joined by Kotov and Creamer undocked from the station and returned to Earth on 1 June 2010, the trio touched down inKazakhstanfollowing 163 days in space, bringing Noguchi's total time in space to 177 days.[31]

Expedition 64/65
On 7 November 2017 JAXA announced Noguchi had been assigned to the crew ofExpedition 62/63as a flight engineer, scheduled for launch toward the end of 2019.[32]On 31 December 2018 he revealed his personal patch for the flight, during a tweet revealing the patch he also announced his mission would be launched aboard aCommercial Crew Vehicle, although it was not made clear whether his flight would take place aboard aSpaceXCrew DragonorBoeing Starliner.[33]
In March 2020 he was assigned toSpaceX Crew-1,[34][35]the first operational flight of aSpaceX Dragon 2spacecraft.[36]Noguchi launched alongside NASA astronautsMichael Hopkins,Victor Glover, andShannon Walker,[37]on 15 November 2020. As well as Noguchi, all were members of theExpedition 64crew on theInternational Space Station.[38]He is the third person, and first non–American, to launch aboard three different spacecraft; the Space Shuttle, the Soyuz, and the Dragon 2.[39]
During his third stay in space, he conducted his fourth career spacewalk withKathleen Rubinson March 5, 2021, spending almost 7 hours outside the ISS.[40]
He currently holds the world record of the longest gap between two consecutive spacewalks by the same person - 15 years and 214 days.[41][42]

Other highlights
Noguchi voices himself in episodes 13 and 26 of theanimeseriesUchū Kyōdai(Space Brothers), which aired on 24 June 2012 and 29 September 2012 respectively.[43]
On 2 August 2015, Noguchi spoke to 33,628 fellow Scouts during the Arena Event at the23rd World Scout Jamboree, held in Japan.[44]
In 2021 he was recognized as a Genius 100 Visionary[45]and contributed his vision of the future to the Genius 100 Foundation and shared it during his induction ceremony which was held on March 14, 2021, while he was aboard the International Space Station.[46]
