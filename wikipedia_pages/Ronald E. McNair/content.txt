Ronald Erwin McNair(October 21, 1950 – January 28, 1986) was an AmericanNASA astronautandphysicist. Hediedat the age of 35 during the launch of theSpace ShuttleChallengeron missionSTS-51-L, in which he was serving as one of threemission specialistsin a crew of seven.
Prior to theChallengerdisaster, McNair flew as a mission specialist onSTS-41-BaboardChallengerfrom February 3 to 11, 1984, becoming the second black American in space.

Background
Ronald Erwin McNair was born inLake City, South Carolina, on October 21, 1950,[1][2]to Carl C. McNair, anauto repairman, and his wife, a high school teacher named Pearl.[3]Growing up alongside his older brother, Carl S.,[4]as well as his younger brother, Eric,[5]McNair grew up in a low-income household, his home having lacked bothelectricityandrunning water.[6]The family later moved into a better, though still poor-quality household following the death of McNair's grandfather. His older brother, writing in a posthumous biography about McNair, described how the family "covered the floor and furniture with pots and pans to catch the water dripping through the roof" when it rained.[4]
In the summer of 1959, McNair refused to leave the segregated Lake City Public Library without being allowed to check out his books. After the police and his mother were called, McNair was allowed to borrow books from the library; the building that housed the library at the time is now named after him.[7]A children's book,Ron's Big Mission, offers a fictionalized account of this event.
McNair attended Lake City Elementary School[8]and Carver High School, where he graduated asvaledictorianin 1967.[9]
In 1971, McNair received aBachelor of Sciencedegree inengineering physics,magna cum laude, from theNorth Carolina Agricultural and Technical State UniversityinGreensboro, North Carolina.[10]At North Carolina A&T, he studied under professorDonald Edwards, who had established the physics curriculum at the university.[11]
In 1976, McNair received aPhDdegree inphysicsfrom theMassachusetts Institute of Technologyunder the guidance ofMichael Feld, becoming nationally recognized for his work in the field oflaser physics. That same year, McNair won the AAU Karate gold medal. He would subsequently win five regional championships and earn a fifth-degree black belt in karate.[12]
McNair received fourhonorary doctorates, as well as a score offellowshipsand commendations. He became a staff physicist at theHughes Research LabinMalibu, California. McNair was also a member of theOmega Psi PhiFraternity.[10]
Mcnair was a member of theBaháʼí Faith.[13]

Astronaut career
In 1978, McNair was selected as one of 35 applicants from a pool of 10,000 for the NASA astronaut program. He was one of several astronauts recruited byNichelle Nicholsas part of a NASA effort to increase the number of minority and female astronauts.[14]McNair flew as a mission specialist on STS-41-B aboardChallengerfrom February 3 to 11, 1984, becoming the second African American to fly in space.

Challengerdisaster
Following the STS-41-B mission, McNair was selected for STS-51-L as one of three mission specialists in a crew of seven. The mission launched on January 28, 1986. He and the other six crew members were killed whenChallengerdisintegratednine miles above the Atlantic Ocean, 73 seconds after liftoff.[10]
McNair was initially buried at Rest Lawn Memorial Park in Lake City, South Carolina. His remains were disinterred in 2004 and moved to Ronald E. McNair Memorial Park, located elsewhere in Lake City.[15]

Music in space
McNair was an accomplishedsaxophonistandjazzenthusiast.
Before his last fateful space mission, McNair worked with French composer and performerJean-Michel Jarreon a piece of music for Jarre's then-upcoming albumRendez-Vous. It was intended that McNair would record his saxophone solo on board theChallenger, which would have made McNair's solo the first original piece of music to have been recorded in space[16](although the song "Jingle Bells" had been played on aharmonicaduring an earlierGemini 6spaceflight). However, the recording was never made, as the flightended in the disasterand the deaths of its entire crew. The final track onRendez-Vous, "Last Rendez-Vous," has the subtitle "Ron's Piece," and the liner notes include a dedication from Jarre: "Ron was so excited about the piece that he rehearsed it continuously until the last moment. May the memory of my friend the astronaut and the artist Ron McNair live on through this piece."[17]McNair was supposed to have taken part in Jarre'sRendez-vous Houstonconcert through a live feed from the orbiting Shuttlecraft.

Public honors
McNair was posthumously awarded the Congressional Space Medal of Honor in 2004, along with all crew members lost in theChallengerandColumbiadisasters.
A variety of public places, people and programs have been renamed in honor of McNair:

 - On January 29, 2011, the Lake City, South Carolina library was dedicated as the Ronald McNair Life History Center.[9]When Ronald McNair was nine, the police and his mother were called because he wished to check out books from this library, which served only white patrons before he arrived. He said, "I'll wait," to the lady and sat on the counter until the police and his mother arrived, and the officer said, "Why don't you just give him the books?" which the lady behind the counter reluctantly did. He said, "Thank you, ma'am," as he got the books.[7]The episode, as recalled by his brother Carl McNair, has been depicted in a short animated film.[19][20][21]
