Biography

Early life and education
Eisele was born June 23, 1930, inColumbus, Ohio, to Herman Eugene Eisele (1899–1964) and Lee Ila June Eisele (néeDavisson; 1900–1964).[1]He graduated fromWest High Schoolin 1948.[2]He was an activeBoy Scoutand earned the rank ofЕagle Scout.[3]He received aBachelor of Sciencedegree from theUnited States Naval AcademyinAnnapolis, Maryland, in 1952,[2]and chose a commission in theUnited States Air Force. He received aMaster of Sciencedegree inAstronauticsfrom the U.S.Air Force Institute of Technology(AFIT),Wright-Patterson AFB, Ohio, in 1960.[4]

Flight experience
Following his commission, Eisele was sent to flight training. He was trained atGoodfellow Air Force Base,Texas,Williams Air Force Base,Arizona, andTyndall Air Force Base,Florida. After receiving hispilot wingsin 1954, Eisele served four years as an interceptor pilot inSouth Dakotaand inLibyauntil 1958.[5]He attended and graduated from theU.S. Air Force Experimental Test Pilot School(Class 62A) atEdwards Air Force Base,California, in 1962; his classmates includedCharles BassettandTheodore Freeman. Eisele was a project engineer and experimentaltest pilotat theAir Force Special Weapons CenteratKirtland Air Force Base,New Mexico. He flew experimental test flights in support of special weapons development programs.[6]He logged more than 4,200 hours flying time, 3,600 of which were injet aircraft.[2]

NASA career
Eisele was part ofNASA's third group of astronauts, selected in October 1963. In early 1966, Eisele was quietly selected as pilot for theApollo 1crew, along with Command PilotVirgil I. "Gus" Grissomand Senior PilotEd White. But after dislocating his shoulder twice during training in January 1966, Eisele was replaced byRoger B. Chaffee. After corrective surgery on January 27, Eisele was named to the crew for the second crewed Apollo flight, with Command PilotWalter "Wally" Schirraand PilotWalter Cunningham. At this time, Eisele was promoted to the Senior Pilot position.[7][8]
In December 1966, Apollo 2 was canceled on the grounds that it would be an unnecessary repeat of Apollo 1, and Schirra, Eisele, and Cunningham became the backups to Grissom's crew. But after Grissom, White, and Chaffee were killed in the Apollo 1 spacecraft fire of January 27, 1967, Schirra, Eisele, and Cunningham were named to fly the first crewed Apollo mission instead. It would ultimately be calledApollo 7.[9]
As the launch date approached, Eisele's participation was at risk; he was having anextramarital affairwith a woman who would later become his second wife.[10]Astronaut Office ChiefDeke Slaytonhad warned the crew that they were all "expendable", and that any extramarital affairs must not become public.[10]
Eisele remained on the crew, and on October 11, 1968, Apollo 7 was launched on an 11-day mission—thefirst crewed flight test of the third generationUnited States spacecraft. By this time, the Senior Pilot title was changed toCommand Module Pilot. Together with spacecraft commander Schirra andLunar Module PilotCunningham, Eisele performed simulatedtransposition and dockingmaneuvers with the upper stage of theirSaturn IBlaunch vehicle, and acted as navigator, taking star sightings and aligning the spacecraft's guidance and navigation platform. The crew completed eight successful test firing maneuvers of the service module's propulsion engine. They also tested the performance of all spacecraft systems and broadcast the first live televised coverage of crew activities.[4]
Apollo 7 was placed in ageocentric orbitwith anapogeeof 153.5 nautical miles (284.3 km; 176.6 mi) andperigeeof 122.6 nautical miles (227.1 km; 141.1 mi).[2]The 260-hour, 4.5 million mile (7.25 Gm; 7.25 million km) shakedown flight was successfully concluded on October 22, 1968, with splashdown occurring in theAtlantic, 8 miles (15 km) from the carrierUSSEssexand only 0.3 miles (0.48 km; 480 m) from the predicted target.[2]Eisele logged 260 hours in space.[2]
Eisele served as backup Command Module Pilot for the 1969Apollo 10flight.[4]Eisele resigned from the Astronaut Office in 1970 and became technical assistant for crewed spaceflight at the NASALangley Research Center, a position he occupied until retiring from both NASA and the Air Force in 1972.[11]
