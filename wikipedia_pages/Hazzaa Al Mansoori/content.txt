Hazzaa AlMansoori[2][3](Arabic:هَزَّاع ٱلْمَنْصُوْرِي,romanized:Hazzāʿ Al-Manṣūrī, surname also spelled "Al Mansoori", full nameHazzaa Ali Abdan Khalfan Al Mansoori(هَزَّاع عَلِي عَبْدان خَلْفَان ٱلْمَنْصُوْرِي) is an Emirati astronaut[4]and the first person from theUnited Arab Emiratesin space. In 2019, he embarked on the UAE's first scientific mission to the International Space Station (ISS). The mission carried the slogan 'Zayed's Ambition', making the UAE the 19th country worldwide, and the first country in the Arab region, to travel to the ISS. He also became the back-up astronaut forSultan Al Neyadifor the UAE's second mission to the ISS, which is the longest Arab space mission. Previously, he was the UAE's youngest F-16 fighter pilot.
On 25 September 2019, he launched aboard theSoyuz MS-15spacecraft to theInternational Space Station, where he stayed for eight days.[5][6]He landed safely inKazakhstan, on 3 October 2019 aboardSoyuz MS-12completing the United Arab Emirates first astronaut mission.[7]

Early life, education, and military career
Al Mansoori was born on 13 December 1983 in theAbu Dhabi suburbofAl Wathba[2][3]moved with his family to Al-Dhafra in western Abu Dhabi. In his childhood, Hazzaa loved exploring and watching stars and meteors on dark nights in the desert of Liwa where he spent most of his childhood. He dreamed of being a pilot and loved to read about airplanes and space trips.[8]
After graduating from Al Seddique High School in Liwa, Al Dhafra region, his passion for astronomy led him to study aviation at the Khalifa bin Zayed Air College.[9]After graduating in 2004, he joined the armed forces and later became one of the most outstanding military pilots. His excellence enabled him to become one of the top candidates to become a Functional Check Flight (FCF) Pilot F-16B60.[10]
He travelled to Arizona, USA, to train on this aircraft for three years, and then returned to the UAE to complete his training. Four years after his return, Al Mansoori became the youngest military pilot on the F-16. He also qualified to be a pilot for flight testing and aircraft assessment and was one of the first Arab and Emirati pilots to take part in the Dubai Air Show's 50th anniversary of UAE Force. He also presented a show at the UAE National Day in 2017, and the 50th anniversary of UAE Air Force in 2018.[3]

The UAE Astronaut Programme
On 6 December 2017,UAE Vice-President and Prime MinisterSheikhMohammed bin Rashid Al Maktoumwrote on hisTwitter account, "I invite young Emiratis to register for the UAE Astronaut Programme through the Mohammed bin Rashid Space Centre".[11]Al Mansoori was one of the first selected astronauts in the first batch of the UAE Astronaut Programme, launched by  Sheikh Mohammed bin Rashid Al Maktoum, Vice President and Prime Minister of the UAE and Ruler of Dubai, and  SheikhMohammed bin Zayed Al Nahyan, Crown Prince of Abu Dhabi and Deputy Supreme Commander of the UAE Armed forces, in 2017. The Programme aims to train and prepare a team of Emirati astronauts and send them to space for various scientific missions.
Al Mansoori was selected from 4,022 candidates, following a series of mental and physical tests in the UAE and abroad. His military background played a huge role in his excellence in physical fitness, which he had previously undergone in the UAE and abroad, to qualify to become an F-16B60 instructor pilot and a demo pilot, SOLO Demonstration pilot in F-16B60. He took on a number of training courses such as the water survival course, GYRO LAP Course up to 9G's,Spatial Disorientationcourse, and the RED Flag Exercise in US, Las Vegas.

Astronaut career
On 3 September 2018, Sheikh Mohammed tweeted: "We announced today our first astronauts to the International Space Station: Hazzaa Al Mansoori and Sultan Al Nayadi. Hazzaa and Sultan represent all young Arabs and represent the pinnacle of the UAE's ambitions".[12]
As part of the agreement betweenMohammed bin Rashid Space Centre(MBRSC) and Russian space agencyRoscosmosto train Emirati astronauts, Al Mansoori went through training atYuri Gagarin Cosmonaut Training CenterinStar City, Russiain preparation for the ISS mission. He also received training in Houston in Texas, and Cologne in Germany, as part of partnership agreements with major space agencies, including NASA, ESA, and JAXA.
April 2019, theMohammed bin Rashid Space Centre(MBRSC) announced that it had selected Al Mansoori as the prime astronaut for an eight-day mission to theInternational Space Station(ISS).[13]Al Mansoori was assigned toSoyuz MS-15, alongside Russian commanderOleg Skripochkaand American flight engineerJessica Meir, both of whom would remain aboard the ISS for 204 days as part ofExpedition 61/62.[14]Unlike Skripochka and Meir, Al Mansoori would land eight days after launch aboardSoyuz MS-12, alongside Russian commanderAleksey Ovchininand American flight engineerNick Hague, who would be returning following a 203-day stay on the ISS as part ofExpedition 59/60.
Al Mansoori, Skripocka and Meir launched on 25 September 2019 from theBaikonur Cosmodrome; the trio spent under six hours free flying in space before docking to theZvezdamodule on the ISS. Originally the spacecraft was scheduled to dock to thePoiskmodule butSoyuz MS-13had moved there a month earlier to allow for the uncrewedSoyuz MS-14spacecraft to dock to the Zvezda module for a short period of time.[15]Following docking the hatches between Soyuz MS-15 and Zvezda were opened, allowing Al Mansoori, Skripochka and Meir to travel inside and meet their six crew mates.
The training programme for the ISS mission included comprehensive training on all sections and units of the ISS and how to use its devices and equipment, emergency fire drills, dealing with low pressure and ammonia leak inside the station, in addition to survival training if the capsule had to land in a cold forest.
Al Mansoori was also trained on the spacesuit, weighing up to 10 kgs and how to wear at zero gravity. He also trained to perform daily tasks such as preparing food, how to use the camera to document events, taking pictures of the Earth, communicating with the ground stations, and other day-to-day tasks during the mission. Al Mansoori underwent more than 90 courses, with the total number of training hours exceeding 1,400 hours.
Due to the "direct handover" that was needed to facilitate Al Mansoori's short duration mission, his mission occurred during an unusual time when nine people were aboard the ISS, the three crew members who had launched on Soyuz MS-12, Aleksey Ovchinin, Nick Hague andChristina Koch, the three who had launched onSoyuz MS-13,Aleksandr Skvortsov,Luca ParmitanoandAndrew Morgan, and the three who had launched aboard Soyuz MS-15.[16]During his short stay aboard the ISS, Al Mansoori conducted 15 experiments created by UAE school students and selected under an MBRSC "Science in space" competition,[17][18]conducted Earth observation experiments, filmed the first ever tour of the ISS inArabicand became the firstMiddle eastern personto be studied following time in microgravity.[19][20]
On 3 October 2019, Al Mansoori, Ovchinin and Hague boarded the Soyuz MS-12 spacecraft, and undocked from the ISS, ending Expedition 60 and officially beginning Expedition 61, the three spent around five hours free flying in space before de-orbiting and touching down on theKazakh Steppe, following which Ovchinin and Al Mansoori were flown toStar City, Russia, before Al Mansoori began his journey back to the UAE.[21]
Al Mansoori further successfully completed his first year of training at NASA'sJohnson Space Centerin 2021 and is currently ready to work as an operator onboard the International Space Station.[citation needed]
He trained in the Neutral Buoyancy Laboratory (NBL), passed evaluations which included using the Extravehicular Mobility Unit (EMU), maintenance of the International Space Station, the Incapacitated Crew Rescue (ICR), and completed theoretical and practical training sessions on the T-38 jet.[citation needed]

Terminology
Flying through an agreement between the UAE and Russian governments, Hazzaa's role aboard the Soyuz and the ISS is referred to as aspaceflight participant(Russian:uchastnik kosmicheskovo poleta)inRoscosmosandNASAdocuments and press briefings.[22][23]NASA has updated the terminology post the return of the mission to Earth on 3 October 2019, and referred to Hazzaa as a visiting astronaut.[24]TheMohammed bin Rashid Space Centrerefers to his mission as "UAE Astronaut Mission 1" or "Zayed's Ambition".[25][26][27]
