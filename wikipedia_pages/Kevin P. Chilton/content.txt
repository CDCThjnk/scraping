Spaceflight experience

STS-49
STS-49, which lasted from May 7–16, 1992, was the maiden voyage of Space ShuttleEndeavour. During the mission, the crew conducted the initial test flight ofEndeavour, performed a record fourEVA’s (spacewalks) to retrieve, repair and deploy the International Telecommunications Satellite (Intelsat), and to demonstrate and evaluate numerous EVA tasks to be used for the assembly ofSpace Station Freedom. Additionally, a variety of medical, scientific and operational tests were conducted throughout the mission. STS-49 logged 213 hours in space and 141Earth orbitsprior to landing atEdwards Air Force Base, California, where the crew conducted the first test of theEndeavour’sdrag chute.[3]

STS-59
STS-59, the Space Radar Laboratory (SRL) mission, April 9–20, 1994, was launched aboard Space ShuttleEndeavour. SRL consisted of three large radars, SIR-C/X-SAR (Shuttle Imaging Radar C/X-Band Synthetic Aperture Radar), and acarbon monoxidesensor that were used to enhance studies of theEarth's surfaceandatmosphere. The imaging radars operated in three frequencies and four polarizations. This multispectral capability of the radars provided information about the Earth's surface over a wide range of scales not discernible with previous single-frequency experiments. The carbon monoxide sensor (MAPS) used gas filter radiometry to measure the global distribution of CO in thetroposphere. Real-time crew observations of surface phenomena and climatic conditions augmented with over 14,000 photographs aided investigators in interpretation and calibration of the data. The mission concluded with a landing at Edwards AFB after orbiting the Earth 183 times in 269 hours.[4]

STS-76
Chilton commandedSTS-76, the third docking mission to the Russian space stationMir, which launched on March 22, 1996, with a crew of six aboardAtlantis. Followingrendezvousand docking with Mir, transfer of a NASA astronaut to Mir for a five-month stay was accomplished to begin a continuous presence of U.S. astronauts aboard Mir for the next two-year period. The crew also transferred 4800 pounds of science and mission hardware, food, water and air to Mir and returned over 1100 pounds of U.S. andESAscience and Russian hardware. The first spacewalk from the Shuttle while docked to Mir was conducted. Experiment packages were transferred from the Shuttle and mounted on the Mir docking module to detect and assess debris and contamination in a space station environment. TheSpacehabmodule carried in the Shuttle payload bay was utilized extensively for transfer and return stowage of logistics and science and also carried Biorack, a small multipurpose laboratory used during this mission for research of plant and animal cellular function. This mission was also the first flight of Kidsat, an electronic camera controlled by classroom students via a Ku-band link between JSC Mission Control and the Shuttle, which used digitized photography from the Shuttle for science and education. Following 145 orbits of the Earth,Atlantislanded with a crew of five at Edwards Air Force Base in California on March 31, 1996, 221 hours after liftoff.[5]

Air Force career resumed
Chilton left NASA in 1998 to become deputy director of political military affairs forAsia,Pacific, and theMiddle Easton theJoint Staff.
