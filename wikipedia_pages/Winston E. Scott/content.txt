Spaceflight experience
STS-72Endeavour(January 11, 1996 – January 20, 1996) was a nine-day flight during which the crew retrieved the Space Flyer Unitsatellite(launched from Japan 10-months earlier), deployed and retrieved the OAST-Flyer satellite, and conducted two spacewalks to demonstrate and evaluate techniques to be used in the assembly of theInternational Space Station. The mission was accomplished in 142 orbits of the Earth and traveled 3.7 millionmiles. Scott logged a total of 214 hours and 41 seconds in space on the mission, including his firstEVAof 6 hours and 53 minutes.
STS-87Columbia(November 19, 1997 – December 5, 1997) was the fourth US microgravity payload flight, and focused on experiments designed to study how the weightless environment of space affects various physical processes, and on observations of the Sun's outer atmospheric layers. Scott performed two spacewalks; the first, a 7-hour 43 minute EVA, featured the manual capture of a Spartan satellite, in addition to testing EVA tools and procedures for future Space Station assembly. The second spacewalk lasted five hours and also featured space station assembly tests. Testing of theAERCam Sprintwas conducted during his EVA. The mission was accomplished in 252 Earth orbits, traveling 6.5 million miles in 376 hours and 34 minutes.
