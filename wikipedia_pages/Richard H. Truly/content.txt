Richard Harrison Truly(November 12, 1937 – February 27, 2024) was an Americanfighter pilot, engineer andastronautwho served as avice admiralin theUnited States Navyand as the eighthadministratorof theNational Aeronautics and Space Administration(NASA) from 1989 to 1992. He was the first former astronaut to head the space agency.
After his departure from NASA, he led theGeorgia Tech Research Institutefrom 1992 to 1997, and theNational Renewable Energy Laboratoryfrom 1997 to 2005.

Early life and education
Born November 12, 1937, inFayette, Mississippi, Truly attended segregated schools in Fayette andMeridian, Mississippi. He received aBachelor of Sciencedegree inaeronautical engineeringfromGeorgia Institute of Technologyin 1959. He was a member of theKappa Alpha Order. He was active in theBoy Scouts of America, achieving its highest rank ofEagle Scout.[1]
Being a member of theNavy ROTCat Georgia Tech, Truly entered the U.S. Navy, where he was ordered to flight school and was designated anaval aviatoron October 7, 1960. His initial tour of duty was inFighter Squadron 33(VF-33) where he flewF-8 CrusadersaboardUSSIntrepidandUSSEnterprise. He made more than 300 carrier landings.[2]
From 1963 to 1965, Truly was first a student and later an instructor at theU.S. Air Force Aerospace Research Pilot SchoolatEdwards Air Force Base,California.[2]

NASA career
In 1965, Truly was among the first military astronauts selected to theUnited States Air Force'sManned Orbiting Laboratory(MOL) program inLos Angeles, California. He joinedNASA Astronaut Group 7in August 1969 after the cancellation of the MOL program. At NASA, he was a member of the astronaut support crew andcapsule communicator(CAPCOM) for all three of the crewedSkylabmissions in 1973, and theApollo–Soyuzmission in 1975. He flew twice on one of the two-man crews for the 1977Approach and Landing Testsof theSpace ShuttleEnterprise, and on theSTS-2mission in 1981, becoming the first man to be launched into space on his birthday. Truly then served as commander ofSTS-8in 1983.[1]
After STS-8, Truly left NASA to become the first commander of theNaval Space Command.[3][4]
It's tough to describe how hard we all worked on MOL. But it was a huge part of our lives and, because of how hard we worked, we all learned a lot about ourselves and our abilities.

Return to flight
Three weeks after theSpace ShuttleChallengerdisaster, Truly returned to NASA to become NASA's Associate Administrator for Space Flight on February 20, 1986.[6]His primary task was to watch over the Space Shuttle's return to flight status. Along with that, he was also responsible for such long term issues as whether or notChallengerwould be replaced, the role the Shuttle would play in the future and the mixture of expendable spacecraft and the shuttle for upcoming missions. While it only took a few days to determine the technical reason for the accident, sorting out the root cause was more difficult. In the end, it took Truly and NASA's "Return to Flight" program 31 months before the Space ShuttleDiscoverysuccessfully flew on September 29, 1988, withSTS-26. In March 1986, Truly noted in a memo that there were several actions NASA needed to accomplish before launching another Shuttle flight. They included "Solid Rocket Motor joint redesign, Critical Items review, and Operations and Maintenance Instructions review".[7]

NASA Administrator
Truly retired from the Navy as a vice admiral shortly before becoming NASA administrator. He was named to head NASA as its eighthadministratorin May 1989, the first astronaut to do so. He held this position until May 1992. He was credited byCarl Saganwith interceding in an internal dispute regarding whetherVoyager 1should be commanded to take one last photograph of Earth before completing its primary mission. The resulting photograph has since become known as thePale Blue Dotphotograph.[8]
On February 12, 1992, Truly was fired as Administrator. Two weeks before, Vice PresidentDan Quaylehad met with Truly, requesting the Administrator step down and accept an ambassadorship. Truly considered the offer but ultimately declined.[9]
When he was fired, Truly said, "I'm floored. I can't explain it".[10]SenatorAl Gore, who would succeed Quayle as vice president a year later, said he was concerned about the move, stating that Truly was "a good man who did a good job under difficult circumstances" and that "I view this as a very troubling sign that ... Quayle's space council may have forced Admiral Truly to leave this job because of the council's insistence on running NASA from the vice president's office."[10]
Observers suggested the firing was due to Truly's focus on large-scale projects like extending the life of theSpace Shuttlerather than smaller, faster missions favored by the administration. It was suggested "that he was captive of his bureaucracy and incapable of making the changes, the reforms, the administration wanted." Others pointed to the battle over theInternational Space Station, which unexpectedly ran into serious problems in Congress, requiring the administration to intervene to save it.[10]

Post-NASA activities
After leaving NASA, Truly became Vice President and Director of theGeorgia Tech Research Institute, part of theGeorgia Institute of Technology, inAtlanta, Georgia.[11]He served in this role from 1992 to 1997.[12]
Then he served as director of theDepartment of Energy'sNational Renewable Energy Laboratoryand as executive vice president of theMRIGlobal(formerly Midwest Research Institute) from 1997–2005.[13]
In May 2007, Retired Vice Admiral Richard Truly testified before the U.S.Senate Committee on Foreign Relationsas a member of a military advisory board on the subject of the threats to U.S. national security posed by globalclimate change.[14]
In 2010, Truly was appointed to the board of trustees of theColorado School of Minesby GovernorBill Ritter.[15]He served as the vice chairman of the board.[16]

Personal life and death
Truly was married to Colleen "Cody" Hanner, and had three children.[1]He died at his home inGenesee, Colorado, on February 27, 2024, at the age of 86.[17][18]

He also received that year theCollier Trophyfor his role in assisting NASA's return to launching crewed missions after theChallengerdisaster.[19]He was awarded the Johnson Space Center Superior Achievement Award in 1972.[20]He also received the American Astronautical Society's Flight Achievement Award in 1977.[21]In 1995, he was inducted into theGeorgia Aviation Hall of Fame.[22]He was awarded the General Thomas D.
