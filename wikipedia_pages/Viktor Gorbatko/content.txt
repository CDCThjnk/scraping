Early life
Viktor Vasilievich Gorbatko was born on 3 December 1934 to Vasili Pavlovich and Matrena Aleksandrovna Gorbatko.[3]Viktor was raised in theNorthern Caucasussettlement ofVentsy-Zaryain theGulkevichdistrict. Gorbatko had four siblings, an older brother, Boris, two older sisters, Elena and Valentina, and Ludmila, the youngest sibling. Viktor was given the opportunity to learn from Nadezdha Karaulova who taught from ABC books that were often censored by the Nazis of everything that had to do with the Soviet histories. Viktor finished seventh grade in 1949 and then attended a secondary school in the Novokubanski district.[3]

Personal life and career
Viktor's interest in becoming a pilot was sparked during the conflict between the Soviets and the Nazis. His siblings often told him stories of brave pilots and their adventures and he too followed in their footsteps. Upon joining theSoviet Armyin 1952, Viktor requested to be assigned to flight school.[3]Following his enlisting, Viktor was sent to the 8th Military Aviation School of Pilot Basic Training in the Ukrainian town ofPavlograd, Dnepropetrovsk Region where he was taught to fly. Viktor graduated on 23 June 1956 as a lieutenant in the Soviet air force.[3]
Gorbatko married his first wife Valentina Pavlovna Ordynskaya. Gorbatko also had two children, Irina his first daughter, and Marina, his second daughter, in 1960.
Gorbatko became part of the 86th Guards Fighter Regiment of the 119th Fighter Division, attached to the 48th Air Army operating out of the Odessa Military District in Moldavia. On 22 June 1957 Gorbatko achieved the rank of senior pilot. He would not achieve the senior lieutenant ranking until 6 August 1958, and in October would achieve the military pilots ranking, third class.[3]
Gorbatko was among the first group ofSovietcosmonauts. He began training in early 1960 but he did not reach space until 1967. His first spaceflight wasSoyuz 7from 12 to 17 October 1969 where he was Research Engineer. This mission tested Soviet lunar equipment but a failed docking withSoyuz 8was the last in-space test before that program was abandoned.[3]Gorbatko was the commander of the 18-daySoyuz 24mission in February 1977 to theSalyut 5space station. This was the last all-military spaceflight by the Soviet Union. In 1980, Gorbatko commandedSoyuz 37which also carriedPham Tuân, the first Vietnamese astronaut. Gorbatko and Pham Tuân flew toSalyut 6and landed in theSoyuz 36capsule that had earlier docked at the space station. Gorbatko spent 7 days and 20 hours in space on this mission.
After leaving the space program in 1982 he taught at the Air Force Engineering Academy inMoscow.[citation needed][4]Upon his death he was buried in theFederal Military Memorial Cemetery.
