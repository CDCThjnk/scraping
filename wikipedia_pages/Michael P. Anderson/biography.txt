- STS-89 Endeavour (January 22–31, 1998). Anderson was a mission specialist on STS-89, the eighth Shuttle-to- Mir Space Station docking mission, during which the crew delivered over 9,000 pounds of scientific equipment, logistical hardware, and water.
- In the fifth and last exchange of a U.S. astronaut, STS-89 delivered Andy Thomas to Mir and returned with David Wolf . The mission's duration was 8 days, 19 hours, and 47 seconds, traveling 3.6 million miles in 138 orbits of the Earth .
- STS-107 Space Shuttle Columbia (January 16–February 1, 2003). Anderson served as payload commander and lieutenant colonel in charge of science experiments on the Columbia , NASA's oldest shuttle. On February 1, 2003, the shuttle was returning to Earth after a successful 16-day trip to orbit, where the crew had conducted more than 80 scientific experiments.
- Unbeknownst to her crew, the orbiter had suffered critical damage during its launch on January 16, when foam from the fuel tank's insulation fell off and tore a hole in Columbia's left wing. During re-entry, the hole allowed super-hot atmospheric gases to penetrate the orbiter's wing, leading to its destruction. The mission's duration was 15 days, 22 hours, and 20 minutes.
- Along with the rest of the STS-107 crew, Anderson was killed upon reentry when the shuttle disintegrated over Texas.
- The Columbia Accident Investigation Board reported that, in addition to the Columbia ' s physical damage, NASA's management culture was partly responsible for the disaster.
