He was posthumously awarded theCongressional Space Medal of Honor.

Early life and education
Michael Philip Anderson was born inPlattsburgh, New Yorkon December 25, 1959, to Barbara and Bobbie Anderson. He was their third child and only son.

In 1981, Anderson graduated with aBachelor of Sciencedegree in physics and astronomy from theUniversity of WashingtoninSeattle. In 1990, he earned aMaster of Sciencedegree in physics fromCreighton UniversityinOmaha.[5]

NASA
Anderson reported to theJohnson Space Centerin March 1995.[2]He completed a year of training and evaluation, and was qualified for flight crew assignment as amission specialist.[2]Anderson was initially assigned technical duties in the Flight Support Branch of theAstronaut Office, but went on to log more than 593 hours in space aboard two Space Shuttle missions.[2]

Space Shuttle missions
STS-89Endeavour(January 22–31, 1998). Anderson was a mission specialist on STS-89, the eighth Shuttle-to-MirSpace Stationdocking mission, during which the crew delivered over 9,000 pounds of scientific equipment, logistical hardware, and water.
In the fifth and last exchange of a U.S. astronaut, STS-89 deliveredAndy Thomasto Mir and returned withDavid Wolf. The mission's duration was 8 days, 19 hours, and 47 seconds, traveling 3.6 million miles in 138orbitsof theEarth.[3]
STS-107Space ShuttleColumbia(January 16–February 1, 2003). Anderson served aspayload commanderand lieutenant colonel in charge of science experiments on theColumbia, NASA's oldest shuttle.[6]On February 1, 2003, the shuttle was returning to Earth after a successful 16-day trip to orbit, where the crew had conducted more than 80 scientific experiments.[7]
Unbeknownst to her crew, the orbiter had suffered critical damage during its launch on January 16, when foam from the fuel tank's insulation fell off and tore a hole inColumbia'sleft wing.[8]During re-entry, the hole allowed super-hotatmospheric gasesto penetrate the orbiter's wing, leading to its destruction.[8]The mission's duration was 15 days, 22 hours, and 20 minutes.
Along with the rest of the STS-107 crew, Anderson was killed upon reentry when the shuttle disintegrated over Texas.
TheColumbiaAccident Investigation Boardreported[9]that, in addition to theColumbia's physical damage, NASA's management culture was partly responsible for the disaster.[10]

Quotes
Prior to the final launch of theColumbia, Anderson told reporters: "There's always that unknown."[1]
