Douglas Harry "Wheels" Wheelock(born May 5, 1960) is an Americanengineerandastronaut. He has flown in space twice, logging 178 days on theSpace Shuttle,International Space Station, and RussianSoyuz. On July 12, 2011, Wheelock announced that he would be returning to active duty with theUnited States Armyin support ofOperation Enduring Freedom.[3]He is currently working withNASAto test theOrion spacecraftat theGlenn Research Centerin Plum Brook, Ohio.[4]

Early life and education
Douglas Wheelock was born inBinghamton, New York, to Olin and Margaret Wheelock. In a pre-flight interview, Wheelock stated that he was inspired to become an astronaut at an early age. He also stated that a major turning point in his life was theApollo 11Moon landing in July 1969.[5]In 1978 Wheelock graduated from Windsor Central High School inWindsor, New York, before attending theUnited States Military AcademyatWest Point.[6]He earned a Master of Science degree in Aerospace Engineering atGeorgia Institute of Technologyin 1992.

Military career
Wheelock spent four years as a cadet at West Point, graduating in the class of 1983 with aBachelor of Sciencedegree inapplied scienceandengineering. After graduation he was commissioned asecond lieutenantin the U.S. Army'sInfantry Branchand entered flight school the next year. In September 1984, then Lieutenant Wheelock graduated at the top of his flight class and was designated anarmy aviator. He subsequently served in the Pacific as a combat aviation section leader, platoon leader, company executive officer, battalion operations officer, and commander of an air cavalry troop in the9th Cavalry. He was later assigned to the Aviation Directorate of Combat Developments as an advanced weapons research and development engineer.
Wheelock was selected as a member of Class 104 at theU.S. Naval Test Pilot Schooland upon completion was assigned as an experimental test pilot with the Army Aviation Technical Test Center (ATTC). His flight testing was focused in the areas of tactical reconnaissance and surveillance systems in theOH-58D,UH-60,RU-21andC-23aircraft. He served as division chief for fixed-wing testing of airborne signal and imagery intelligence systems in support of the National Program Office for Intelligence and Electronic Warfare.
While on active duty, Wheelock received aMaster of Sciencedegree inaerospace engineeringfromGeorgia Techin 1992. In August 1996 Wheelock was assigned to theJohnson Space Centeras a Space Shuttle integration test engineer. His technical duties involved engineering liaison for launch and landing operations of the Space Shuttle. He was selected as the vehicle integration test team lead for the joint Space Shuttle and Russian Space StationMirmissionSTS-86, and lead engineer for International Space Station hardware fit checks.
Wheelock is a graduate of the Army Airborne and Air Assault Courses, the Infantry and Aviation Officer Advanced Courses, the Combined Arms Services Staff School, the Material Acquisition Management Course, and theU.S. Army Command and General Staff College. In July 2011, Wheelock left for a tour of duty in support of Operation Enduring Freedom. A dual-rated master army aviator astronaut, he has logged over 2,500 flight hours in 43 different rotary and fixed-wing aircraft.[6]

NASA career
In August 1998 Wheelock reported forNASAastronaut candidate training. Having completed the initial two years of intensive Space Shuttle and Space Station training, he was assigned to the Astronaut Office ISS Operations Branch as a Russian Liaison, participating in the testing and integration of Russian hardware and software products developed for the ISS. He worked extensively with the Energia Aerospace Company inMoscow, Russia, developing and verifying dual-language procedures for ISS crews. Wheelock led joint U.S./Russian teams to theBaikonur CosmodromeinKazakhstanto oversee bench reviews, inventory, loading and launch of the first four uncrewed ISS resupply capsules.
In 2001, Wheelock assumed duties as the crew support astronaut for the ISSExpedition 2crew, which was in orbit for 147 days from March 2001 to August 2001, and for the ISSExpedition 4crew, which was on orbit for 195 days from December 2001 to June 2002. He was the primary contact for all crew needs, coordination, planning and interactions, and was the primary representative of the crews while they were in orbit. In August 2002, Wheelock was assigned as a spacecraft communicator (CAPCOM) in the Mission Control Center inHouston, Texas. In this role, he was the primary communication link between crews in orbit and the ground support team in the Control Center. His work as a CAPCOM culminated in his assignment as the lead CAPCOM for the ISSExpedition 8mission, which was 194 days in duration.
In July 2004, Wheelock served as anaquanautduring theNEEMO 6mission aboard theAquariusunderwater laboratory, living and working underwater for ten days.[7]
In January 2005 and again in 2016, he was assigned as NASA's Director of Operations – Russia where he served at theGagarin Cosmonaut Training CenterinStar City, Russia.  He was responsible for supporting Russia-based training, logistic, and administrative needs of NASA astronauts preparing for flight on the ISS. Wheelock was the primary liaison between Star City and NASA operations in Houston, including medical, training, science, contracting, public affairs, and administration departments. He was also responsible for liaison duties between NASA and theRussian Space Agency, as well as the Russian aerospace industry.[6]
After his first spaceflight, Wheelock was assigned as the backup toT.J. Creamerfor theSoyuz TMA-17/Expedition 22/Expedition 23mission to theInternational Space Station. Creamer completed a successful 163-day mission from 2009 to 2010.[8]
As of September 2019, Wheelock is currently working as an astronaut trainer testing systems aboard theOrion spacecraft.[4]That month, he contributed to an article inThe Columbus Dispatchdetailing the inaccuracies of the space science fiction filmAd Astra.[9]

Spaceflight experience
On October 23, 2007, Wheelock launched on his first spaceflight aboardSpace ShuttleDiscovery. During theSTS-120mission, Wheelock wasMission Specialist3 on a multinational crew whose mission was to deliver theNode 2module to the International Space Station. Wheelock participated in threespacewalkswith fellow astronautScott Parazynskiin order to perform mission critical tasks on the exterior of the Station. The spacewalks involved outfitting the Node 2 module, storing an S-band antenna, work on theIntegrated Truss Structure, andExternal Stowage Platform2. During the mission a solar array on the P6 truss tore requiring an emergency repair by Wheelock and Parazynski. Parazynski attached cufflinks to the solar array allowing it to expand without additional damage. Wheelock orbited the Earth 238 times during the 15-day mission.[10]
Wheelock launched to the International Space Station on June 15, 2010, aboard theSoyuz TMA-19spacecraft withFyodor YurchikhinandShannon Walker.
Wheelock joined theExpedition 24crew in progress.[11]During the mission he participated in several scientific investigations. On July 31, 2010, a pump module on the exterior of the Space Station failed. Wheelock andTracy Caldwell-Dysonmade three spacewalks to replace the module, during which he sustained long-term damage to his vision.[12][9]The failed pump module was later returned home onSTS-135.[13]
On September 22, 2010, Wheelock took command of theInternational Space Stationat the beginning ofExpedition 25.[14]He is the first U.S. Army officer to command the ISS.[15]Wheelock and his crew continued science and maintenance of the space station.
Wheelock is sharing pictures of the Earth, station and views of space viaTwitter, asSoichi Noguchidid before him.[16]In September 2010, Wheelock tweeted photos from space ofHurricane Earl.[17]He also participated in aNASA Tweetupon March 16, 2011.[18]
He became the first person to "check in" from space on October 22, using the mobile social networking applicationFoursquare. Wheelock's check-in to the International Space Station launched a partnership between NASA and Foursquare to connect its users to the space agency, enabling them to explore the universe and discover Earth.[19]
He returned to Earth on November 26, 2010, aboard the Soyuz.
