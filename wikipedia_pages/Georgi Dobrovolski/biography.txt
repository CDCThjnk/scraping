- Georgy Timofeyevich Dobrovolsky ( Russian : Георгий Тимофеевич Добровольский ; 1 June 1928 – 30 June 1971) was a Soviet cosmonaut who commanded the three-man crew of the Soyuz 11 spacecraft. They became the world's first space station crew aboard Salyut 1 , but died of asphyxiation because of an accidentally opened valve. They were the first and only humans to have died in space.
- Dobrovolsky, Viktor Patsayev and Vladislav Volkov flew on the Soyuz 11 mission and were the world's first and last three crew to die during a space flight .
- After a normal re-entry , the capsule was opened and the crew was found dead. It was discovered that a valve had opened just prior to leaving orbit that had allowed the capsule's atmosphere to vent away into space , suffocating the crew.
- Dobrovolsky's ashes were placed in an urn in the Kremlin Wall Necropolis on Red Square in Moscow. Among the pallbearers were Alexei Leonov (who had been the prime-crew commander scheduled to launch on Soyuz 11 ), Vladimir Shatalov , Andriyan Nikolayev , and American astronaut Thomas P. Stafford . Dobrovolsky was posthumously awarded the title of Hero of the Soviet Union , the Order of Lenin , and the title of Pilot-Cosmonaut of the USSR .
