George David Low(February 19, 1956 – March 15, 2008)[1]was an Americanaerospaceexecutive and aNASAastronaut.  With undergraduate degrees in physics and mechanical engineering and a master's degree in aeronautics and astronautics, he worked in theJet Propulsion Laboratory(JPL) at theCalifornia Institute of Technologyin the early 80's, before being picked as an astronaut candidate by NASA in 1984. In addition to holding some technical assignments, he logged more than 700 hours in space (including stints on theColumbia, theAtlantis, and theEndeavourSpace Shuttles), before he left NASA in 1996 to pursue a career in the private sector. He was the son ofGeorge M. Low, the manager of the Apollo Spacecraft Program Office, and later, the 14th president ofRensselaer Polytechnic Institute.

Personal life
Low was born February 19, 1956, inCleveland,Ohio, to George and Mary Ruth Low (nee McNamera),[2]and was active in theBoy Scouts of Americawhere he achieved its second highest rank,Life Scout. He was married to the former JoAnn Andochick ofWeirton, West Virginia. They had three children. He enjoyedtennis, lacrosse,scuba diving,running, and spending time with his family. In 1968 it was his father who proposed thatApollo 8fly to the Moon.
Low died ofcolon canceron March 15, 2008, atReston Hospital Centerin Virginia.[3]

Education
Low graduated fromLangley High School,McLean, Virginia, in 1974; received aBachelor of Sciencedegree inPhysics-EngineeringfromWashington & Lee Universityin 1978, aBachelor of Sciencedegree inmechanical engineeringfromCornell Universityin 1980, and aMaster of Sciencedegree inaeronauticsandastronauticsfromStanford Universityin 1983. He also went toHarvard UniversityandJohns Hopkins University.

Organizations

Awards and honors
 - NASA Space Flight Medals(3)
 - NASA Exceptional Service Medal
 - NASA Outstanding Leadership Medal
 - honorary doctorate of engineering degree fromRensselaer Polytechnic Institute
 - Cygnus Orb-D1spacecraft, the first Cygnus to travel, was named the S.S.G. David Lowin his memory. All subsequent Cygnus spacecraft are named for personnel involved in space.

Aerospace career
Low worked in the Spacecraft Systems Engineering Section of the Jet Propulsion Laboratory,California Institute of Technology, from March 1980 until June 1984. During that time he was involved in the preliminary planning of several planetary missions, anAutonomous Spacecraft Maintenancestudy, and the systems engineering design of theGalileo spacecraft. Following a one-year leave to pursue graduate studies, Low returned to JPL where he was the principal spacecraft systems engineer for theMars Geoscience/Climatology Orbiter(Mars Observer) mission.

NASA career
Selected by NASA in May 1984 as an astronaut candidate, Low became an astronaut in June 1985. He held a variety of technical assignments including work on theCanadarm(RMS), onExtra-vehicular activity(EVA), and Orbiter test and checkout tasks at theKennedy Space Center. Low served as a spacecraft communicator (CAPCOM) in theMission Control Centerduring STS Missions 26, 27, 29 and 30. He also served as the lead astronaut in theMan-Systems GroupandStation Operations Groupof theSpace Station Support Office. In 1993, Low was a member of theRussian Integration Teamwhich worked for several months inCrystal City, Virginiato define the changes from the oldSpace Station Freedomto the newInternational Space Station. In 1994, he served as the Manager of theEVA Integration and Operations Office, and in 1995 he served as an assistant in theNASA Legislative Affairs Officewhere he worked with Members of theUnited States Congressand their staffs to keep them informed about NASA's aeronautics and space programs. A veteran of three space flights, Low logged over 714 hours in space, including nearly six hours on aspacewalk. He was a mission specialist onSTS-32(January 9-20, 1990) andSTS-43(August 2-11, 1991), and was the payload commander onSTS-57(June 21 to July 1, 1993).
Low left NASA in February 1996 to pursue an aerospace career withOrbital Sciences Corporation'sLaunch Systems GroupinDulles, Virginia.

Spaceflight experience
On his first mission, Low was a crew member on STS-32 which launched from the Kennedy Space Center,Florida, on January 9, 1990. On board theSpace ShuttleColumbiathe crew successfully deployed theSyncom IV-F5communications satellite, and retrieved the 21,400-poundLong Duration Exposure Facility(LDEF) using theCanadarmor SRMS. They also operated a variety of middeck materials and life sciences experiments, as well as theIMAX camera. Following 173 orbits of the Earth in 261 hours,Columbiareturned to a night landing atEdwards Air Force Base,California, on January 20, 1990.
Low next served as the flight engineer aboard theSpace ShuttleAtlantisonSTS-43. The nine-day mission launched from the Kennedy Space Center, Florida, on August 2, 1991. During the flight, crew members deployed the fifthTracking and Data Relay Satellite(TDRS-E), in addition to conducting 32 physical, material, and life science experiments, mostly relating to theExtended Duration Orbiter(EDO) andSpace Station Freedom. After 142 orbits of theEarthin 213 hours, the mission concluded with a landing on Runway 15 at the Kennedy Space Center on August 11, 1991.
OnSTS-57, Low served as payload commander aboard theSpace ShuttleEndeavour, which launched from the Kennedy Space Center, Florida, on June 21, 1993. The primary objective of this flight was the retrieval of theEuropean Retrievable Carriersatellite (EURECA) using the Canadarm. Additionally, this mission featured the first flight ofSpacehab, a commercially provided middeck augmentation module for the conduct of microgravity experiments. Spacehab carried 22 individual flight experiments in materials and life sciences research. During the mission Low, along with crew matePeter J. K. Wisoff, conducted a 5-hour, 50-minute spacewalk during which the EURECA communications antennas were manually positioned for latching, and various extravehicular activity (EVA) tools and techniques were evaluated for use on future missions.Endeavourlanded at the Kennedy Space Center on July 1, 1993, after 155 orbits of the Earth in 239 hours.
