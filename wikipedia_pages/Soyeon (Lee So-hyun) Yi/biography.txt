- Soyeon's songs are also inspired by cartoons, books and dramas. "Idle Song" was created because she was inspired by the SpongeBob SquarePants theme song.

Instead, she took on the role out of necessity: "At first, I really didn't know I'd be writing these songs ... but our debut was getting delayed because we didn't have a song. So that's when I thought, I should write our song, and started writing a title track." She described her composition process as starting with writing melodies on a blank page with just a piano or a beat, noting that "it is common to have a track maker, someone who writes melodies and putting a melody on a mostly completed beat." In the production of the group's debut song "Latata", Soyeon began with moombahton beats and simple instruments such as percussion, putting them on loop and coated them with melody.

Poet Seo Hyo-in wrote that Soyeon "covers all aspects of producing, from composition and writing, rap making and setting the concept" but "doesn't overshadow the other members." She praised Soyeon for maximizing the strengths of each member, allowing them to find their own artistic freedom.
- Soyeon expressed her desire for more women to take part in record production, believing that there are no gender boundaries when it comes to arts forms like music, performances and gaming. She stated, "When I write, I don't think about gender. No 'we're a girl group', women, men or age. I just write what's on my mind." In June 2020 interview with MTV , on using the pronoun "she" in " Oh My God ", Soyeon remarked that she "didn't want to limit that 'she' to a certain being or a certain definition, so it's open to anything" and that "all kinds of love are valuable and must be respected."

  - Soyeon expressed her desire for more women to take part in record production, believing that there are no gender boundaries when it comes to arts forms like music, performances and gaming. She stated, "When I write, I don't think about gender. No 'we're a girl group', women, men or age. I just write what's on my mind." In June 2020 interview with MTV , on using the pronoun "she" in " Oh My God ", Soyeon remarked that she "didn't want to limit that 'she' to a certain being or a certain definition, so it's open to anything" and that "all kinds of love are valuable and must be respected."

- Image and impact
  - Media outlets have labelled Soyeon a versatile artist, "triple threat", and Alpha girl due to her success as a rapper, singer, and songwriter and skills in record production and dancing. Cube Entertainment noted that Soyeon's presence in (G)I-dle was vital to the group's popularity and helped set them apart from their peers. Also nicknamed "survival born monster", stemming from her appearance on multiple survival shows, she has established herself as a next-generation "producer-dol". RBW 's Cosmic Sound (Kim Ki-hyun) and Cosmic Girl (former Rania member Yoo Joo-yi) described Soyeon as a "genius songwriter-idol", and Kukinews named her the first successful female Korean idol singer who also produces music for both her group and other artists. Journalist Park Eun-hae dubbed Soyeon the Korean Lady Gaga due to her small figure; courage to try challenging concepts without genre limitations; and unique position in the Korean entertainment industry as a writer, producer, and performer.
  - Soyeon has been regarded as a role model for young women. Various artists cited her as an inspiration, including Majors' Aki, ANS' Dalyn, Woo!ah! 's Songyee, Craxy's KaRin Lightsum 's Jian and Juhyeon, Lunarsolar 's Eseo, H1-Key 's Hwiseo, Blank2y 's Siwoo, and Adya's Sena, Purple Kiss ' Yuki. South Korean producer and songwriter Ryan S. Jhun expressed his admiration for the competition Queendom , on which (G)I-dle appeared, and shared that he hopes to work with Soyeon one day.
  - During the recording of "My Name is Malgeum" ( 내이름 맑음 ), QWER member Hina recalled, "Since my voice has a lot of nasal sounds, she told me, 'Sound like a man, don't be shy, and try your best.' I was very moved by Soyeon's consideration during the whole recording process, and I think my vocal range has broadened thanks to this experience".

- Philanthropy
  - In April 2020, Soyeon donated 30,000 hand sanitizers during the COVID-19 pandemic in South Korea through the Holt Children's Welfare Association.
  - On June 2, 2021, Soyeon opened a personal Instagram account with several photos of selfies and an arm tattoo. Later, Soyeon revealed the tattoo was a "consent for organ donation" tattoo on V Live . She stated, "I saw an article saying that an average of 5 people a day died waiting for an organ donor. I thought about what I could do for others in my life, and then I came to a conclusion. It was a decision I made after cautiously thinking."
  - On January 18, 2022, Soyeon donated 20,000 briquettes to the Sharing Briquettes of Love campaign to help those in need, including unprivileged and low-income families,  throughout the cold winter.
  - In February 2023, Soyeon donated ₩ 20 million to the Hope Bridge National Disaster Relief Association in order to aid those affected by the 2023 Turkey–Syria earthquake .
  - On July 17, 2024, Soyeon donated ₩ 100 million to the Hope Bridge National Disaster Relief Association, as a member of Hope Bridge Honors Club, to help recover from heavy rain damage across South Korea. She stated, "I participated in the donation with the hope that it would be a small comfort to those affected by this heavy rain."
  - On March 28, 2025, Soyeon delivered another ₩ 100 million in donations to the same foundation, Hope Bridge National Disaster Relief Association, to support for residents in areas affected by forest fires such as Ulsan , Gyeongbuk, Gyeongnam and temporary shelters. A statement was issued where she stated, "I wanted to convey even a little comfort. I sincerely hope that those who are suffering will return to their daily lives as soon as possible," she added, "I think it's time for all of us to reach out."
