Artistry

Influences
Soyeon stated that her bandmates are her primary songwriting inspirations.[63]She was heavily influenced by her rap teacher in high school, who Soyeon recalled "taught [her] the basics like how to write good lyrics and how to melt in your sincerity."[64]She also namedCL,[65]Britney SpearsandAvril Lavigneas her role models with the latter two being the inspiration behindI Never Die's concept and fashion.[66]
Soyeon's songs are also inspired by cartoons, books and dramas.[67]"Idle Song" was created because she was inspired by theSpongeBob SquarePantstheme song.[68]"Latata" was inspired by Song Joon-geun's catchphrase "arata rata rata" inKBS2'sGag Concert.[69][70]"Hann (Alone)" was inspired by Kim Sowol's poem "Azaleas". "Senorita" was inspired by Spanish song, "Despacito" (2017).[71]"Uh-Oh" was inspired by the expression and the tone used by staff, where she'd shot a reality show,To Neverlandin the U.S.[72]"Lion" was inspired from live-actionThe Lion Kingduring her group's debut in Japan.[72]
ForI Trustalbum concept, Soyeon revealed that she got inspired by watching anisekaianime,KonoSuba: God's Blessing on this Wonderful World! Legend of Crimson,[73][74]and "Luv U" was created and choreographed from the scene heart-finger V by the animationSugar Sugar Rune.[75]"Dumdi Dumdi" was inspired by the 2016Disney'sZootopia.[76]The inspiration for "Hwaa" came to Soyeon when Shuhua once said 'winter girl' in a conversation. She took the idea and created the concept of a woman trapped in winter.[77]
ForI Never Die, Soyeon compared the album with theMarineford warinOne Pieceanime series – "the war is a very important event inOne Piece. The story revolves around the members who have grown up two years after fighting a war that they thought was an insurmountable crisis and like the members are separated to grow up. Like the manga, I thoughtI Never Dieis an album that depicts (G)I-dle after the war. This album, which is represented by growth and shock, was perfected with passion and fierceness."[78]"Tomboy" was inspired by the fictional character,Cruella de Vil.[79]
"If we had done music that taught and gave lessons before, this time we wanted to express the songs [message] with a light andcomicalpoint along with themotifof the movieI Feel Pretty.
Before the release ofI Love, Soyeon appeared in episode 445 ofI Live Alonewhere she was seen leading a meeting for the next album in which she said "I have a message I want to convey," that "It's better to be hated as I am than to be loved as I am not." She stated that she was inspired by late actressMarilyn Monroefor the next album concept. "I want to break the prejudice of 'sexy'. You can think of it as ametaphoricalexpression that 'even if I am loved by you again, I will (still) be me'," she added.[81]
Soyeon noted in the press release for the albumI Feel, that she was inspired by the 2018 movieI Feel Prettyand the subject revolves around conveying a message aboutself-esteemandconfidence.[80]

Songwriting and musical style
Although Soyeon trained in songwriting classes before her debut, she never intended to be (G)I-dle's primary songwriter. Instead, she took on the role out of necessity: "At first, I really didn't know I'd be writing these songs ... but our debut was getting delayed because we didn't have a song. So that's when I thought, I should write our song, and started writing a title track."[63]She described her composition process as starting with writing melodies on a blank page with just a piano or a beat, noting that "it is common to have a track maker, someone who writes melodies and putting a melody on a mostly completed beat." In the production of the group's debut song "Latata", Soyeon began withmoombahtonbeats and simple instruments such as percussion, putting them on loop and coated them with melody. She considers her bandmates while writing and tries to avoid the lyrics involving "me" or "I".[64]Soyeon further emphasized the importance of appealing to emotions to "mak[e] music without prejudice ... I think it's the music that anyone can sympathize with. Our group is multinational and has no language barrier."[82]
For (G)I-dle's first preliminary performance on the competition showQueendom, Soyeon proposed a sorceress concept for "Latata", an arrangement thatIZMpraised as "an entirely original song". According to the magazine, her consistent confidence in her group, song and herself both on and offstage is because "she has a clear image of what she wants to create."[83][84][85]Poet Seo Hyo-in wrote that Soyeon "covers all aspects of producing, from composition and writing, rap making and setting the concept" but "doesn't overshadow the other members." She praised Soyeon for maximizing the strengths of each member, allowing them to find their own artistic freedom.[86]
"All stereotypes must be crushed. The stereotype that you're too young to do something. The stereotype that limits female idols. Music has no gender."
Soyeon expressed her desire for more women to take part in record production,[87]believing that there are no gender boundaries when it comes to arts forms like music, performances and gaming.[88]She stated, "When I write, I don't think about gender. No 'we're a girl group', women, men or age. I just write what's on my mind."[89]In June 2020 interview withMTV, on using the pronoun "she" in "Oh My God", Soyeon remarked that she "didn't want to limit that 'she' to a certain being or a certain definition, so it's open to anything" and that "all kinds of love are valuable and must be respected."[90]

Image and impact
Media outlets have labelled Soyeon a versatile artist, "triple threat", andAlpha girldue to her success as a rapper, singer, and songwriter and skills in record production and dancing.[6][91]Cube Entertainment noted that Soyeon's presence in (G)I-dle was vital to the group's popularity and helped set them apart from their peers.[92]Also nicknamed "survival born monster", stemming from her appearance on multiple survival shows, she has established herself as a next-generation "producer-dol".[93][94]RBW's Cosmic Sound (Kim Ki-hyun) and Cosmic Girl (formerRaniamember Yoo Joo-yi) described Soyeon as a "genius songwriter-idol",[95]andKukinewsnamed her the first successful femaleKorean idolsinger who also produces music for both her group and other artists.[96]Journalist Park Eun-hae dubbed Soyeon the KoreanLady Gagadue to her small figure; courage to try challenging concepts without genre limitations; and unique position in the Korean entertainment industry as a writer, producer, and performer.[97]
Soyeon has been regarded as a role model for young women.[98]Various artists cited her as an inspiration, including Majors' Aki,[99]ANS' Dalyn,[100]Woo!ah!'s Songyee,[101]Craxy's KaRin[102]Lightsum's Jian and Juhyeon,[103][104]Lunarsolar's Eseo,[105]H1-Key's Hwiseo,[106]Blank2y's Siwoo,[107]and Adya's Sena,[108]Purple Kiss' Yuki.[109]South Korean producer and songwriterRyan S. Jhunexpressed his admiration for the competitionQueendom, on which (G)I-dle appeared, and shared that he hopes to work with Soyeon one day.[110]
During the recording of "My Name is Malgeum" (내이름 맑음),QWERmember Hina recalled, "Since my voice has a lot of nasal sounds, she told me, 'Sound like a man, don't be shy, and try your best.' I was very moved by Soyeon's consideration during the whole recording process, and I think my vocal range has broadened thanks to this experience".[111]

She stated, "I saw an article saying that an average of 5 people a day died waiting for an organ donor. I thought about what I could do for others in my life, and then I came to a conclusion. It was a decision I made after cautiously thinking."[114][115]
On January 18, 2022, Soyeon donated 20,000 briquettes to the Sharing Briquettes of Love campaign to help those in need, including unprivileged and low-income families,  throughout the cold winter.[112]
