Kregel graduated from the U.S. Air Force Academy in 1978, and earned hispilot wingsin August 1979 atWilliams Air Force Base,Arizona. From 1980 to 1983 he was assigned toF-111aircraft atRAF Lakenheath. While serving as an exchange officer flyingA-6Eaircraft with the U.S. Navy atNaval Air Station Whidbey Island,Seattle, and aboard theUSSKitty Hawk, Kregel made 66 carrier landings during a cruise of the Western Pacific. His next assignment was an exchange tour at theU.S. Naval Test Pilot SchoolatPatuxent River, Maryland. Upon graduation he was assigned toEglin AFB,Florida, conducting weapons and electronic systems testing on theF-111,F-15, and the initial weapons certification test of theF-15Eaircraft. Kregel resigned from active duty in 1990 in order to work for NASA. He has logged over 5,000 flight hours in 30 different aircraft.

NASA experience
In April 1990, Kregel was employed byNASAas anaerospace engineerand instructor pilot. Stationed atEllington Field,Houston, Texas, his primary responsibilities included flying as an instructor pilot in the Shuttle Training Aircraft (STA) and conducting the initial flight test of theT-38avionics upgrade aircraft.
Selected by NASA in March 1992, Kregel reported to theJohnson Space Centerin August 1992. He completed one year of training and is qualified for assignment as a pilot on future Space Shuttle flight crews. Additional duties have included: Astronaut Support Personnel team at theKennedy Space Centerin Florida supportingSpace Shuttlelaunches and landings;CAPCOMin Mission Control. A veteran of four space flights, Kregel has logged 52 days, 17 hours, 20 minutes and 5 seconds in space. He was the pilot onSTS-70(July 13–22, 1995) andSTS-78(June 20 to July 7, 1996), and was the spacecraft commander onSTS-87(November 19 to December 5, 1997) andSTS-99(February 11–22, 2000).

Space flight experience
STS-70Discovery(July 13–22, 1995) was a 9-day mission during which the crew performed a variety of experiments in addition to deploying the sixth and final NASA Tracking and Data Relay Satellite. The mission was completed in 142 orbits of the Earth, traveling 3.7 million miles in 214 hours, 20 minutes. STS-70 was the first mission controlled from the new combined control center.
STS-78Columbia(June 20 to July 7, 1996) was a 16-day Life and Microgravity Spacelab mission. It included studies sponsored by ten nations and five space agencies, was the first mission to combine both a full microgravity studies agenda and a comprehensive life science investigation, and served as a model for future studies on board theInternational Space Station. STS-78 orbited the Earth 271 times, covering 7 million miles in 405 hours, 48 minutes.
STS-87Columbia(November 19 to December 5, 1997) was the fourth U.S Microgravity Payload flight and focused on experiments to study how the weightless environment of space affects various physical processes, and observations of the Sun's outer atmospheric layers. Two members of the crew performed an EVA (spacewalk) which featured the manual capture of a Spartan satellite and also tested EVA tools and procedures for future Space Station assembly. The mission was accomplished in 252 Earth orbits during which the crew traveled 6.5 million miles in 376 hours, 34 minutes.
STS-99(February 11–22, 2000) was an 11-day mission during which the international crew aboardEndeavourworked dual shifts to support payload operations. The Shuttle Radar Topography Mission mapped more than 47 million miles of the Earth's land surface. The STS-99 mission was accomplished in 181 Earth orbits, traveling over 4 million miles in 268 hours and 38 minutes.
