Judith Arlene Resnik(April 5, 1949 – January 28, 1986) was an Americanelectrical engineer,software engineer,biomedical engineer, pilot andNASA astronautwho died in theSpace ShuttleChallengerdisaster. She was the fourth woman, the second American woman and the first Jewish woman of any nationalityto fly in space, logging 145 hours in orbit.
Recognized while still a child for her intellectual brilliance, Resnik was accepted atCarnegie Institute of Technologyafter becoming only the 16th woman in the history of the United States to have attained a perfect score on theSATexam. She graduated with a degree inelectrical engineeringfromCarnegie Mellonbefore attaining aPhDin electrical engineering from theUniversity of Maryland.
Resnik worked forRCAas an engineer on Navy missile and radar projects, as a senior systems engineer forXerox Corporation, and published research on special-purpose integrated circuitry. She was also a pilot and made research contributions tobiomedical engineeringas aresearch fellowat theNational Institutes of Health.
At age 28, Resnik was selected by NASA as amission specialist. She was part ofNASA Astronaut Group 8, the first group to include women. While training on the astronaut program, she developed software and operating procedures for NASA missions. Her first space flight was theSTS-41-Dmission in August and September 1984, the twelfthSpace Shuttleflight, and themaiden voyageofSpace ShuttleDiscovery, where her duties included operating itsrobotic arm. Her second Shuttle mission wasSTS-51-Lin January 1986 aboardSpace ShuttleChallenger. She died when the orbiter broke up shortly after liftoff and crashed into the ocean.

Early life
Judith Arlene Resnik was born inAkron, Ohio, on April 5, 1949,[1][2]the daughter of Marvin Resnik, anoptometrist, and his wife Sarah (néePolensky),[3]a legal secretary.[4]She had a brother, Charles, who was four years younger.[5][6]Her father was the son of a rabbi, and he had been born inPrelukein Ukraine. His family had emigrated toMandatory Palestinein the 1920s, and then to the United States after the1929 Hebron massacre.[7]He was fluent in eight languages and served in the U.S. Army duringWorld War IIin military intelligence, conducting prisoner of war interrogations and aerial reconnaissance in thePacific Theaterand the subsequentoccupation of Japan.[8]Resnik grew up in an observantJewishhome, studying atHebrew schoolat Beth El Synagogue in Akron and celebrating herBat Mitzvahin 1962, which at the time was not a common occurrence.[3][9]
Resnik was noticed for her intellectual ability while still in kindergarten, and she entered elementary school a year early.[10]She attended Fairlawn Elementary School,[11]Simon Perkins Junior High School,[12]andHarvey S. Firestone High School.[11]She was an outstanding student, excelling in mathematics, languages and piano.[13]She played classical piano, and at one point considered a career as a concert pianist.[10][14]Before college, she attained a perfect score on herSATexam,[15]the only woman in the country to do so that year and only the 16th woman in US history.[14]She graduated from Firestone in 1966 asvaledictorianand runner-uphomecoming queen.[16][17]
Although her mother disapproved of her dating, Resnik had a series of boyfriends. She preferred to socialize with boys from the nearbyCopley High Schoolrather than from Firestone, where her intellectual reputation preceded her. She met Len Nahmi (who eventually became a pilot)[18]at a basketball game. He was half Irish and half Lebanese, and her mother disapproved of him. Nonetheless, she continued to see him secretly, and when she stayed with a cousin inClevelandwhile taking a college course available to high school students, she also met with him there. Her parents acrimoniously divorced while she was a teenager, and custody was given to her mother, as was the custom in the United States. Her mother's dislike of Nahmi became more intense, and Nahmi eventually ended their relationship to spare Resnik more pain. When she was 17, she prepared and filed a successful court case so that her custody could be switched from her mother to her father, with whom she was particularly close. She tore up letters from her mother unopened.[19][20]Her father remarried, and she acquired twin stepsisters, Linda and Sandy, who were nine years older than she was, and with whom she became close.[21]
At age 17, Resnik enteredCarnegie Institute of Technology,[10]where she joined theAlpha Epsilon Phisorority.[21]She began college intending to become a math major, but in her second year, after attendingelectrical engineeringlectures with her boyfriend Michael Oldak, she developed a passion for the subject.[10][16]She was one of three female students in electrical engineering.[10]She was a gourmet cook and a navigator insports car rallies, in which she took part many times with Oldak in hisTriumph TR6.[17]She earned aBachelor of Sciencedegree in electrical engineering from Carnegie Mellon University (as it now was) in 1970.[22]She became a member ofTau Beta Pi,Mortar Board,[23]andEta Kappa Nuhonor societies.[1]
Resnik married Oldak on July 14, 1970.[24]Her mother attended the wedding; two sets of invitations were sent out, one describing her as her father's daughter, and the other as her mother's.[19]Upon graduation from Carnegie Mellon, Resnik and Oldak moved toMoorestown, New Jersey, where they both worked forRCA. She was a design engineer on missile and radar projects and won the Graduate Study Program Award. She performed circuit design for the missile and surface radar division. While at RCA, she worked for the Navy building custom integrated circuitry for thephased-array radarcontrol systems and developed electronics and software for NASA'ssounding rocketandtelemetrysystems programs. An academic paper she wrote on special purpose integrated circuitry caught the attention of NASA during this time.[10]She registered formaster's degreeevening courses at theUniversity of Pennsylvania. In 1971, Oldak was accepted intoGeorgetown University Law Center, and they moved toWashington, D.C.Resnik continued to work for RCA, transferring to its office inSpringfield, Virginia, and she continued pursuing her master's degree at theUniversity of Maryland. She then entered a doctoral program. Resnik and Oldak divorced in 1975—he wanted children and she did not—but they remained in contact and on good terms.[17][25]
While working on her doctorate, Resnik switched jobs in 1974, and went to work as aresearch fellowinbiomedical engineeringat the Laboratory of Neurophysiology at theNational Institutes of Health.[24]As a biomedical engineer, Resnik researched the physiology of visual systems.[10]In 1977 she earned herPhDin electrical engineering with honors at the University of Maryland,[16]writing her dissertation on "Bleaching kinetics of visual pigments".[2]Her research involved the effects of electrical currents on theretina.[24]An academic paper co-written by her concerning the biomedical engineering of optometry ("A novel rapid scanning microspectrophotometer and its use in measuring rhodopsin photoproduct pathways and kinetics in frog retinas") was published in theJournal of the Optical Society of Americain 1978.[26]

NASA astronaut

Selection and training
After her divorce from Oldak, Resnik reconnected with Nahmi, who was now a commercial airline pilot. When he heard that theNational Air and Space Administration(NASA) was recruiting women to become astronauts, he encouraged her to apply. They readCarrying the Fire, the 1974 book byApollo 11astronautMichael Collins, and she met with him in his office at theNational Air and Space Museum.[19]She also met with another former astronaut,John Glenn, who was now aUnited States senatorfrom her home state of Ohio.[27]Nahmi convinced her to obtain aprivate pilot's licenseto bolster her credentials. Resnik qualified as a pilot in 1977, while completing her Ph.D., having achieved near-perfect scores in her flying exams (two 100s and a 98). When she received a promotion at RCA and again when she completed her doctorate, he suggested she send NASA atelegraminforming them.[19]
Resnik's mentor and advisor, ProfessorAngel G. Jordan, then Dean ofCarnegie Mellon College of Engineeringand laterprovostof Carnegie Mellon, also encouraged Resnik to apply for the program.[16]After she completed her doctorate, Resnik became a seniorsystems engineerforXerox CorporationinLos Angeles, working in product development.[28]She rented an apartment inRedondo Beach, California, where she would jog along the beach to improve her stamina and reduce her weight.[29]
In January 1978, at age 28, Resnik was selected as amission specialistwithNASA Astronaut Group 8, one of 29 men and six women selected out of 8,029 applicants in the firstNASA astronautselection that included women.[30][15]This involved taking a pay cut, as her new salary was considerably less than what she was being paid at Xerox.[29]Her fellow astronaut candidates nicknamed her "JR". She dated some of them.[31]She trained intensely and with great determination, focusing particularly on her physical fitness.[19]She piloted theNorthrop T-38 Talon, an aircraft used by NASA astronauts for transportation and training.[32]AstronautJerome Aptdescribed her as "an excellent pilot".[16]Asked about Resnik, fellow astronautRhea Seddonsaid: "I thought she was really really bright, obviously a very beautiful person, flirtatious, funny. She was just a live wire. We would do the happy hours, or we'd go on these NASA trips, and Judy was just a star attraction."[33]
Resnik worked on research into the principle of orbital systems, flight software and the development of systems of manual control of spacecraft. She developed thesoftwareand operating procedures for the Space Shuttle'sRemote Manipulator System(RMS). She also developed the deployment systems for the tethered satellite systems and worked on orbiter development, writing software for NASA to use on its missions.[34][10]She disliked the part of her job that required making public appearances and drumming up support for the space program. She avoided television interviews when possible, and resented intrusive questions about her private life, such as questions about her divorce.[35]
Other astronauts felt that either Resnik orSally Ridewould become the first woman in the group to fly inspace, as they received the sorts of technical assignments that best prepared them for flight, such ascapsule communicator(CapCom) duties.[36][33]The shortlisted candidates for the mission specialist assignments for theSTS-7mission included all six women, but since the mission involved the use of the RMS, the choice of the first to fly on the Space Shuttle narrowed to Resnik, Ride andAnna Fisher, who had specialized on it. Resnik was considered best qualified, but was passed over in favor of Ride because it was felt that Resnik was less comfortable with public affairs, and the first American woman to fly in space would attract an unusual amount of public interest.[37][38]

STS-41-D
In February 1983, Resnik was assigned to the crew ofSTS-41-D, the twelfth Space Shuttle flight, themaiden voyageof theSpace ShuttleDiscovery, along withHenry Hartsfield,Michael Coats,Steven HawleyandMike Mullane.[39][40]During a visit to a contractor's factory, Resnik whispered to Mullane: "there are no maidens on this flight".[41]She was the center of attention on such visits, and one contractor engineer became a stalker, sending her unwelcome letters, poems and gifts. Eventually, after he appeared in the office, he had to be dealt with by NASA security.[42][i]After Hawley and Mullane had a fawning encounter with actorBo Derek, who was working on the filmTarzan, the Ape Man, Resnik started calling Mullane "Tarzan" and Hawley "Cheetah";[44][45]when the office secretaries heard about this, they began referring to the STS-41-D crew as the "zoo crew".[46]Resnik was a fan of the actorTom Selleck, and had a coffee cup that said: "Excuse No. 1: I'm Saving Myself for Tom Selleck."[47]Her crewmates hid a poster of Tom Selleck behind the bathroom curtain onDiscovery.[48]
The STS-41-D mission's launch was delayed three times. The first attempt, on June 25, 1984, was aborted due to a failure of the backup computer. The following day, during the second attempt, the computer detected a fault in one of theSpace Shuttle main engines, and shut them down four seconds before liftoff. This was the first time a NASA space mission had been aborted after starting the engines sinceGemini 6in 1965.Discoveryhad to be taken back to theVehicle Assembly Building, where the faulty engine was replaced. A further launch attempt was made on August 29, but was again delayed for a day due to a software issue. Finally, on August 30,Discoverylifted off for the first time, and was in orbit eight minutes later.[49]Resnik invited her family to watch the launch from the VIP viewing area. This included her father, brother, Oldak and Nahmi. Her mother was also in attendance, to avoid bad publicity.[50]
Resnik became the second American woman in space. She was also the firstAmerican Jewishastronaut to go into space, and the first Jewish woman.[51]Her duties included operating the Space Shuttle's robotic arm, which she helped create and on which she was an expert.[52]On the first day of the mission, Resnik and Mullane deployed the first of three commercial communications satellites, the SBS-4 satellite forSatellite Business Systems.[49][53]On the second day, the crew released a second satellite,SyncomIV-2, also known as Leasat 2, for theU.S. Navy.[49]While Hartsfield was filming its release with theIMAXcamera for the documentaryThe Dream is Alive, Resnik's hair became caught in the camera's belt feed mechanism. The camera jammed, and she had to be cut free with scissors. Strands of loose hair floated about the cabin. Hartsfield informed themission control centerthat the camera had jammed, but did not say why. Coats was able to repair the camera, and Hartsfield continued filming, while Resnik kept her distance.[54][55]The crew deployed a third satellite,Telstar 302forTelesatof Canada, without mishap the following day.[49]
That day Resnik also deployed the OAST-1 solar array wing,[49]considered a potential future way of generating more electrical power during space missions. After performing several dynamic tests that day and the next, she reported that the experiment was well-behaved and matched ground simulations of the array.[56]During the mission, she held up a hand-written sign saying "Hi Dad" to the cameras, and in a live televised broadcast told PresidentRonald Reagan"the Earth looks great". When Reagan asked her if the flight was all she hoped it would be, she replied, "It certainly is and I couldn't have picked a better crew to fly with."[56]After the mission, Hartsfield described Resnik as the "astronaut's astronaut",[10]and Mullane wrote: "I was also happy to be crewed with Judy ... She was smart, hardworking, and dependable, all the things you would want in a fellow crewmember."[57]
Discoverylanded atEdwards Air Force Baseon September 5, after a flight lasting 6 days and 56 minutes.[49]

Space ShuttleChallengerdisaster
On January 29, 1985, NASA announced that Resnik had been assigned to the crew ofSTS-51-L. The main objective of this mission was to launchTDRS-B, the second in a series of NASATracking and Data Relay Satellites.[58]It would also carry the Spartan (Shuttle Pointed Autonomous Research Tool for Astronomy), which would use two ultravioletspectrometersto study the tail ofComet Halley.[59]Resnik was primarily responsible for the operation of the RMS and, with fellow astronautRonald McNair, would deploy and later retrieve the Spartan.[60]The flight would also carryChrista McAuliffe, a teacher-observer selected as part of NASA'sTeacher in Space Project.[59]Resnik was part of the team of astronauts who flew to Washington, D.C., to speak to the 113 finalists, and provide them an insider's view of a Space Shuttle mission. They were taken to the National Air and Space Museum, where they viewedThe Dream is Alivewith its scenes of Resnik deploying a satellite and eating and sleeping in space. She told them that it was a shame that they could not all fly in space, but privately she disagreed with NASA's decision to send non-astronauts on the Space Shuttle.[61]Resnik's assignment was tied to McAuliffe's; NASA wanted McAuliffe to fly with a veteran female astronaut.[62]
Initially scheduled for January 24, 1986, the launch was delayed until January 28 by rain, high winds, a troublesome bolt on theSpace ShuttleChallenger's hatch and freezing temperatures.[63]Resnik's father and stepmother, and her brother and his family watched the launch from the VIP area, as did her Firestone High math teacher. Selleck declined her invitation to attend. Resnik carried a locket for her niece, a signet ring for her nephew and a cigarette lighter for Nahmi.[64]
Challengerlifted off fromKennedy Space Center Launch Complex 39Bat 11:38 on January 28. A minute later it broke up, torn apart by aerodynamic forces after a catastrophic failure of anO-ringseal on the starboardsolid rocket booster. The cabin remained intact until it hit the water at 207 mph, killing all on board.[65]Resnik's last recorded words aboardChallengerregarded scanning for "LVLH" (local vertical/local horizontal), reminding the cockpit crew of a switch configuration change to theattitude direction indicator.[10][ii]
Following the disaster, examination of the recovered vehicle cockpit revealed that thePersonal Egress Air Packswere activated for pilotMike Smithand two other crew members. The location of Smith's activation switch on the back of his seat means either Resnik orEllison Onizukalikely activated it for him. Mike Mullane wrote:
Mike Smith's PEAP had been turned on by Judy or El, I wondered if I would have had the presence of mind to do the same thing had I been inChallenger's cockpit. Or would I have been locked in a catatonic paralysis of fear? There had been nothing in our training concerning the activation of a PEAP in the event of an in-flight emergency. The fact that Judy or El had done so for Mike Smith made them heroic in my mind. They had been able to block out the terrifying sights and sounds and motions ofChallenger's destruction and had reached for that switch. It was the type of thing a true astronaut would do—maintain their cool in the direst of circumstances.[68]
This is the only evidence that shows Onizuka and Resnik were alive after the cockpit separated from the vehicle. If the cabin had lost pressure, the air packs alone would not have sustained the crew during the two-minute descent.[69]Resnik's remains were recovered from the crashed vehicle cockpit by Navy divers from theUSSPreserver.[70]The remains of the seven crew members were cremated, comingled and buried at the Space ShuttleChallengerMemorial inArlington National Cemeteryon May 20, 1986.[71]

Legacy
Resnik was posthumously awarded theCongressional Space Medal of Honor.[72]She was also awarded theNASA Space Flight Medalfor her first flight.[1]Landmarks and buildings named for her include a dormitory at heralma mater, Carnegie Mellon University;[73]Judith A. Resnik Elementary School inGaithersburg, Maryland;[74]Judith A. Resnik Community Learning Center (formerly Fairlawn Elementary) which she had attended was renamed in her honor in her hometown of Akron;[75]and Judith A. Resnik Middle School, established in 2016, inSan Antonio, Texas.[76]Acrater on the Moonwas named after her,[77]as was one on Venus, where all features are named after women.[78]Anasteroid,3356 Resnik, was also named after her.[79]
A memorial to Resnik and the rest of the crew ofChallengerwas dedicated inSeabrook, Texas, where she lived while stationed at theJohnson Space Center.[80]She is also commemorated on theSpace Mirror Memorialat theKennedy Space Center.[81]TheIEEE Judith A. Resnik Awardwas established in 1986 by theInstitute of Electrical and Electronics Engineersand is presented annually to an individual or team in recognition of outstanding contributions to space engineering in areas of relevance to the IEEE.[82]TheSociety of Women Engineers(SWE) awards the Resnik Challenger Medal annually to "a woman who has changed the space industry, has personally contributed innovative technology verified by flight experience ... and will be recognized through future decades as having created milestones in the development of space as a resource for all humankind."[83]TheChallenger Centerwas established in 1986 by the families of theChallengercrew, including Resnik's brother, Charles, in honor of the crew members.[84]Its goal is to increase children's interest inscience, technology, engineering and mathematics.[85][86][87]
