Oleg Valeriyevich Kotov(Russian:Олег Валериевич Котов) was born on 27 October 1965 inSimferopol, Crimean oblast in theUkrainian SSR. After a career as a physician assigned to the Soviet space program, he joined the Russian cosmonaut corps. He has flown three long duration spaceflights on the International Space Station logging over 526 days in space. Most recently, Kotov flew on theSoyuz TMA-10M/Expedition 37/Expedition 38long duration spaceflight, from September 2013 until March 2014.

Personal
Kotov is married to Svetlana Nikolayevna Kotova (previously, Bunyakina). They have two children, Valeria Olegovna Kotova (daughter), born in 1994 and Dmitry Olegovich Kotov (son), born in 2002. Kotov's parents, Valeri Efimovich Kotov and Elena Ivanovna Kotova, reside in Moscow. He enjoys diving, computers, and photography.[1]

Education
Kotov finished high school in Moscow in 1982 and entered theS. M. Kirov Military Medical Academy, from which he graduated in 1988.

Awards
Kotov was awarded the Hero of the Russian Federation medal, The Combat Heroism Russian Federation Armed Forces Medal of I and II degrees and the Service Medal of I, II and III degrees.

Experience
After graduation from the Academy in 1988, Kotov served at the Gagarin Cosmonaut Training Center, where he held the positions of Deputy lead test-doctor and Lead test doctor. He dealt with problems of altitude physiology and space flight effects on a human body. He gained experience in practical training and medical support of spacewalks on Mir, and was a crew surgeon and instructor for biomedical training and science program training. He is a certifiedscuba diver.

Roscosmos career
In 1996 Kotov was selected as a cosmonaut candidate by the Gagarin Cosmonaut Training Center (GCTC). From June 1996 to March 1998, he completed a course of basic training for spaceflight. In March 1998, he received a test-cosmonaut qualification. Since July 1998, he has been a cosmonaut-researcher and test-cosmonaut of the Cosmonaut Office. From May–August 1998, he trained for a flight on the Soyuz and the Mir station as a backup crewmember to the Mir-26 mission.
Since October 1998, he participated in advanced training for ISS flights. He served as a flight engineer and Soyuz commander on the ISS-6 and ISS-13 backup crews.
From February–October 1999, Kotov served as a Representative of GCTC at the Johnson Space Center. During 2001–2002 he worked as a CAPCOM for Expedition-3 and 4 inmission control center, Moscow and Moscow Support Group in the Mission Control Center at Houston. In 2004 he became Chief of the CAPCOM Branch in the Cosmonaut Office.

Expedition 15
He was a member (Flight Engineer) of the ISSExpedition 15, that launched on 7 April 2007 fromBaikonur Cosmodrome, aboardSoyuz TMA-10spacecraft, together withFyodor Yurchikhinand space touristCharles Simonyi.
On October 21, Kotov returned to Earth inside the Soyuz TMA-10 capsule after spending 196 days and 17 hours in space. The TMA-10 spacecraft undocked from the ISS at 07:14 UTC on October 21, and deorbit occurred at 09:47. Duringatmospheric re-entry, the spacecraft transitioned to aballistic reentry, resulting in it landing west ofArkalyk, approximately 340 km (210 mi) northwest of the intendedKazakhstanlanding site.[2]

Expedition 22/23
Kotov commandedSoyuz TMA-17and was assigned toExpedition 22as a Flight Engineer andExpedition 23as the Commander aboard theInternational Space Station.[3]
On 1 May 2010 Kotov manually flew the final 1 km of the incomingProgress M-05Mspacecraft to the ISS after it failed to return to the proper docking orientation following a series of thruster firings. Kotov using the station's Telerobotically Operated Rendezvous Unit (TORU) system took control and guided the spacecraft to successfully dock with the ISS. Later Russian Mission Control announced that Kotov's Progress M-05M rendezvous work may have set a new record.[4]
Kotov returned to Earth on 2 June 2010 aboard the Soyuz TMA-17 spacecraft. The Soyuz capsule touched down at about 3:25 UTC on the central steppes of Kazakhstan.[5]

Expedition 37/38
Kotov launched onSoyuz TMA-10Mon 25 September 2013, with Russian cosmonaut Sergey Ryazansky and American astronautMichael Hopkinsjoined Expedition 37 as a Flight Engineer. On 7 November Kotov and rest of the five Expedition 37 crew members were joined by new Expedition 38 flight engineers,Mikhail Tyurin,Koichi WakataandRick Mastracchio. This was first time since October 2009 that nine people resided on the space station without the presence of a space shuttle. Soon after Kotov became the station commander for the second time since Expedition 23 in 2010.
Kotov and cosmonaut Ryazansky made history after they took an Olympic torch for a spacewalk for the first time ever on 9 November 2013. Kotov returned to Earth on 11 March 2014 after staying at the ISS for 166 days.

Spacewalks
On 30 May 2007 at 19:05 GMT, accompanied by Fyodor Yurchikhin, Kotov began his firstspacewalk, lasting 5 hours and 25 minutes, during which they installed protective panels to shield the ISS from space debris.[6]
On 6 June 2007 Kotov performed his second spacewalk from thePirsdocking compartmentairlock. Along with Yurchikhin, Kotov installed a section of Ethernet cable on theZaryamodule, installed additional Service Module Debris Protection (SMDP) panels onZvezda, and deployed a Russian scientific experiment. The two cosmonauts returned to the ISS at 4:00 p.m. EDT to wound up the 5 hours, 37 minutes spacewalk.[7]
On 14 January 2010 Kotov again ventured outside the ISS with fellow Russian cosmonautMaksim Surayevto begin his third spacewalk. The spacewalking duo connected cables between thePoiskandZvezdamodules, installed docking targets and Kurs aerials and attached additional handrails to exit hatches.[citation needed]The spacewalk lasted 5 hours and 44 minutes.[8]
On 9 November 2013, Kotov performed his fourth spacewalk outside the ISS withSergey Ryazansky.
They took the Olympic torch for the 2014 Winter Olympic Games outside ISS. They also continued work on an extravehicular activity workstation and biaxial pointing platform by removing launch brackets and bolts, as well as retrieving an experimental package. The planned installation of a foot restraint on the mounting seat of the workstation was deferred to a future spacewalk after the spacewalkers noticed some issues with its alignment. The spacewalk lasted 5 hours 50 minutes.
On 27 December 2013, Kotov and Ryazansky were outside of the ISS to perform a spacewalk. The cosmonauts attached two (high and medium resolution) cameras as part of a commercial agreement between a Canadian firm and the Russian Federal Space Agency to provide Earth views to internet-based subscribers. Kotov routed the data and telemetry cables for the medium resolution camera, however, flight control team at the Russian Mission Control Center did not see the expected telemetry and electrical connectivity from the cameras. Eventually, the cosmonauts were instructed to remove the cameras and return them back inside the ISS for further analysis.  In addition to the camera installation work,  Kotov and Ryazansky also removed and jettisoned the Vsplesk experiment package designed to monitor seismic effects using high-energy particle streams in the near-Earth environment. The spacewalkers next attached the more sophisticated earthquake-monitoring Seismoprognoz experiment to a Zvezda handrail. The spacewalk lasted 8 hours and 7 minutes and extended the record for the longest Russian spacewalk set byExpedition 36cosmonautsFyodor YurchikhinandAlexander Misurkin, who conducted a 7-hour, 29 minute spacewalk on 16 August 2013.[9]
On 27 January 2014, Kotov did perform his sixth spacewalk outside the ISS with cosmonaut Ryazansky.[10]The cosmonauts completed work that could not be finished up during their last spacewalk on December 27. After exiting the Pirs docking compartment, the two cosmonauts arrived at the outside of the Zvezda service module. They then installed a high resolution camera and a medium resolution camera to capture Earth imagery, however the medium resolution camera again experienced telemetry issues. Kotov and Ryazansky also removed a cassette container attached to the Pirs docking compartment, installed earlier as part of a materials exposure experiment. They also removed a worksite interface adapter attached to a portable data grapple fixture on the Zarya module to ensure that future operations with the Canadarm2 robotic arm will not be disrupted. The spacewalk marked the fourth EVA conducted during the Expedition 38 and lasted six hours and eight minutes.
