Sharon Christa McAuliffe(néeCorrigan; September 2, 1948 – January 28, 1986) was an American teacher and astronaut fromConcord, New Hampshire, who died on theSpace ShuttleChallengeron missionSTS-51-L, where she was serving as apayload specialist.[2]
McAuliffe received her bachelor's degree in education and history fromFramingham State Collegein 1970 and her master's degree in education, supervision and administration[3]fromBowie State Universityin 1978. McAuliffe took a teaching position as a social studies teacher atConcord High SchoolinNew Hampshirein 1983.
In 1985, McAuliffe was selected from more than 11,000 applicants to theNASATeacher in Space Projectand was scheduled to become the first teacher to fly in space.[4]As a member of missionSTS-51-L, she was planning to conduct experiments and teach two lessons fromChallenger. On January 28, 1986,the shuttle broke apart 1 minute 13 seconds after launch, killing all onboard. After her death, several schools were named in her honor, and McAuliffe was posthumously awarded theCongressional Space Medal of Honorin 2004. In 2024, a statue of McAuliffe was installed on the grounds of theNew Hampshire State Capitol.

Early life
Sharon Christa Corrigan was born on September 2, 1948, inBostonas the oldest of the five children of accountant Edward Christopher Corrigan (1922–1990), who was of English and Irish descent;[5]and Grace Mary Corrigan (née George; 1924–2018), a substitute teacher,[6][7][8]whose father was of LebaneseMaronitedescent.[5]McAuliffe was a great niece of Lebanese-American historianPhilip Khuri Hitti.[9]McAuliffe was known by her middle name from an early age, and in later years she signed her name "S. Christa Corrigan", and eventually "S. Christa McAuliffe".[10]
The year McAuliffe was born, her father was completing his sophomore year atBoston College.[6]Not long after, he took a job as an assistantcomptrollerin a Bostondepartment store, and they moved toFramingham, Massachusetts, where McAuliffe attendedMarian High School, graduating in 1966.[11]She went on to earn a bachelor's degree in 1970 from Framingham State College, nowFramingham State University. As a youth, McAuliffe was inspired byProject Mercuryand theApollo Moon landing program. The day afterJohn Glennorbited the Earth inFriendship 7, she told a friend at Marian High, "Do you realize that someday people will be going to the Moon? Maybe even taking a bus, and I want to do that!"[12]McAuliffe wrote years later on herNASAapplication form: "I watched theSpace Agebeing born, and I would like to participate."[6][13]
In 1970, McAuliffe married her longtime boyfriend whom she had known since high school,Steven J. McAuliffe, a 1970 graduate of theVirginia Military Institute. The couple moved closer to Washington, D.C., so that he could attend theGeorgetown University Law Center.[6][11]They had two children, Scott and Caroline, who were nine and six respectively when she died.[14]
McAuliffe obtained her first teaching position in 1970, as an American history teacher at Benjamin Foulois Junior High School inMorningside, Maryland.[15]From 1971 to 1978, she taught history and civics at Thomas Johnson Middle School inLanham, Maryland. In addition to teaching, McAuliffe completed a Master of Arts in education supervision and administration fromBowie State UniversityinMaryland.[16]In 1978, she moved toConcord, New Hampshire, when Steven accepted a job as an assistant to theNew Hampshire Attorney General.[6]McAuliffe taught 7th and 8th grade American history and English in Concord, New Hampshire, and ninth grade English inBow, New Hampshire, before taking a teaching post atConcord High Schoolin 1983.[17]
McAuliffe was a social studies teacher, and taught several courses including American history, law, and economics, in addition to a self-designed course: "The American Woman".[18]Taking field trips and bringing in speakers were an important part of her teaching techniques. According toThe New York Times, McAuliffe "emphasized the impact of ordinary people on history, saying they were as important to the historical record as kings, politicians or generals."[19]

Teacher in Space Project
In 1984, PresidentRonald Reaganannounced theTeacher in Space Project, and McAuliffe learned about NASA's efforts to find their first civilian, an educator, to fly into space.[20]NASA wanted to find an "ordinary person," a gifted teacher who could communicate with students while in orbit.[6][15]McAuliffe became one of more than 11,000 applicants.[20]
I cannot join the space program and restart my life as an astronaut, but this opportunity to connect my abilities as an educator with my interests in history and space is a unique opportunity to fulfill my early fantasies. I will never give up.
NASA hoped that sending a teacher into space would increase public interest in theSpace Shuttleprogram, and also demonstrate the reliability of space flight at a time when the agency was under continuous pressure to find financial support.[22][23][24]President Reagan said it would also remind Americans of the important role that teachers and education serve in their country.[25]
TheCouncil of Chief State School Officers, a non-profit organization of public officials in education, was chosen by NASA to coordinate the selection process.[26]Out of the initial applicant pool, 114 semi-finalists were nominated by state, territorial, and agency review panels. McAuliffe was one of two teachers nominated by the state of New Hampshire.[27]The semi-finalists gathered in Washington, D.C., from June 22–27, 1985, for a conference on space education and to meet with the Review Panel that would select the 10 finalists.[26]
On July 1, 1985, McAuliffe was announced as one of the 10 finalists, and on July 7 she traveled toJohnson Space Centerfor a week of thorough medical examinations and briefings about space flight.[26]The finalists were interviewed by an evaluation committee composed of senior NASA officials, and the committee made recommendations toNASA AdministratorJames M. Beggsfor the primary and backup candidates for the Teacher in Space Project. On July 19, 1985, Vice PresidentGeorge H. W. Bushannounced that McAuliffe had been selected for the position. Another teacher,Barbara Morgan, served as her backup.[28]According to Mark Travis of theConcord Monitor, it was McAuliffe's manner that set her apart from the other candidates.[27]NASA official Alan Ladwig said "she had an infectious enthusiasm", and NASA psychiatrist Terrence McGuire toldNew Womanmagazine that "she was the most broad-based, best-balanced person of the 10."[27]
Later that year, McAuliffe and Morgan each took a year-long leave of absence from teaching in order to train for a Space Shuttle mission in early 1986.[6][29]NASA paid both their salaries. While not a member of theNASA Astronaut Corps, McAuliffe was to be part of theSTS-51-Lcrew, and would conduct experiments and teach lessons from space. Her planned duties included basic science experiments in the fields ofchromatography,hydroponics,magnetism, andNewton's laws.[30]She was also planning to conduct two 15-minute classes from space, including a tour of the spacecraft, called "The Ultimate Field Trip", and a lesson about the benefits of space travel, called "Where We've Been, Where We're Going, Why".[15][31]The lessons were to be broadcast to millions of schoolchildren via closed-circuit TV. To record her thoughts, McAuliffe intended to keep a personal journal like a "woman on theConestoga wagonspioneering the West."[32]
After being chosen to be the first teacher in space, McAuliffe was a guest on several television programs, includingGood Morning America; theCBS Morning News; theToday Show; andThe Tonight Show Starring Johnny Carson, where, when asked about the mission, she stated, "If you're offered a seat on a rocket ship, don't ask what seat. Just get on."[33]She had an immediate rapport with the media, and the Teacher in Space Project received popular attention as a result.[6]

Disaster and aftermath
On January 28, 1986, McAuliffe boardedChallengerwith the other six crew members of STS-51-L. Only 73 seconds into its flight at an altitude of 48,000 ft (14,630.400 m), the shuttle broke apart, resulting in the deaths of all seven crew members.[6][34]
According to NASA, the accident had such a significant effect on the nation in part because of the excitement over McAuliffe's presence on the shuttle. Many schoolchildren were viewing the launch live, and media coverage of the accident was extensive.[35]
Barbara Morgan, her backup, became a professional astronaut in January 1998,[29]and flew on Space Shuttle missionSTS-118, to theInternational Space Station, on August 8, 2007, aboardEndeavour, the orbiter that replacedChallenger.[29][36]

Legacy
McAuliffe was buried at Blossom Hill Cemetery in her hometown of Concord.[37]McAuliffe has since been honored at many events, including theDaytona 500NASCARrace in 1986.[38]TheMcAuliffe-Shepard Discovery Centerin Concord, the Christa Corrigan McAuliffe Center for Education and Teaching Excellence atFramingham State University, the Christa McAuliffe Intermediate School in Brooklyn, NY, the McAuliffe Branch Library in Framingham, MA, the Christa McAuliffe Adult Learning Center in Baton Rouge, LA, the S. Christa McAuliffe Elementary School in Lowell, Massachusetts, Christa McAuliffe Elementary School in Sammamish, Washington and Christa McAuliffe Middle School in Jackson, NJ, Christa McAuliffe Middle School in Bay City, MI,IS 187 - Christa McAuliffein Brooklyn, New York, and The Christa McAuliffe Residential Community (CMRC) dorm and wellness center on the campus of her alma mater of Bowie State University in Bowie, Maryland, were named in her memory,[39][40][41][42][43]as are the asteroid3352 McAuliffe,[44]the craterMcAuliffeon theMoon,[45][46]and a crater on the planetVenus, which was named McAuliffe by theSoviet Union.[47]Approximately 40 schools around the world have been named after McAuliffe, including theChrista McAuliffe Space Education CenterinPleasant Grove, Utah.[48][49]Christa McAuliffe Park in Green Bay, WI is named after her.
Scholarships and other events have also been established in McAuliffe's memory. The Christa McAuliffe Technology Conference has been held inNashua, New Hampshire, every year since 1986, and is devoted to the use of technology in all aspects of education.[50]The NebraskaMcAuliffe Prizehonors aNebraskateacher each year for courage and excellence in education.[51]Grants in McAuliffe's name, honoring innovative teachers, are provided by theAmerican Association of State Colleges and Universitiesand theNational Council for the Social Studies.[52][53]
In 1990, her home town of Concord New Hampshire opened theMcAuliffe-Shepard Discovery Center. The center is "dedicated to the New Hampshire space pioneers Christa McAuliffe and Alan Shepard. The facility is a 45,000 square feet air and space museum easily accessible to all of New England and mid coast states. The museum features a vintage Crusader Jet and is one of only five planetariums in all of North America with a 10K projection system. The planetarium features engaging displays with several showings each day, constantly rotating new, imaginative and entertaining shows.[54]
TheChrista McAuliffe Space Centerin Pleasant Grove, Utah, teaches school children about space, and is visited by students from around the world. It has a number of space flight simulators.
The center was started in 1990 by Victor Williamson, an educator at Central Elementary School. It is a 4,000-square-foot (370 m2) building added onto Central Elementary. It aims to teach astronomy and social studies through the use of simulators; the first, Voyager, proved itself popular, and a new planetarium was added in 2020. As the years passed, the demand for flights expanded and new ships were commissioned.[55]
McAuliffe was portrayed byKaren Allenin the 1990 TV movieChallenger.[56]In October 2018, it was announced thatMichelle Williamswas cast to portray McAuliffe inThe Challenger, another retelling of theSpace Shuttle Challenger disaster.[57][58]In 2019, McAuliffe was portrayed by Erika Waldorf in theindependent filmThe Challenger Disaster. The spaceship on the 1996–1997 children's science-fiction seriesSpace Cases, about a group of students lost in space, was calledChrista.[59]In 2005, the documentary filmChrista McAuliffe: Reach for the Stars, celebrating the life and legacy of Christa McAuliffe, premiered on the film festival circuit, with screenings at the prestigiousHigh Falls Film Festivaland theSanta Barbara International Film Festival. Directed by Renee Sotile and Mary Jo Godges, the film is narrated by Academy Award winnerSusan Sarandonand features an original song, “Christa’s Song,” written and performed by Grammy Award winnerCarly Simon.[60]January 2006, to commemorate the 20th anniversary of Christa McAuliffe’s passing and the tragedy of the Space Shuttle Challenger,CNNaired Christa McAuliffe: Reach for the Stars over 20 times in theCNN Presentsformat, featuring an on-set introduction and narration byPaula Zahn.[61]
McAuliffe's parents worked with Framingham State College to establish the McAuliffe Center.[48]Her husband, Steven J. McAuliffe, later remarried, and in 1992 became afederal judge,[62]serving with theUnited States District Court for the District of New Hampshirein Concord. Her son, Scott, completed graduate studies inmarine biology, and her daughter, Caroline, went on to pursue the same career as her mother: teaching.[48]On July 23, 2004, McAuliffe and all the other 13 astronauts lost in both theChallengerandColumbiadisasters were posthumously awarded theCongressional Space Medal of Honorby PresidentGeorge W. Bush.[63]
On January 28, 2016, several teachers who competed alongside McAuliffe for a seat on theChallengertraveled toCape Canaveral, Florida, for a 30th anniversary remembrance service, along with her widower, Steven, and son, Scott. After remarking that 30 years had passed, Steven said "Challengerwill always be an event that occurred just recently. Our thoughts and memories of Christa will always be fresh and comforting."[64]In 2017, McAuliffe was inducted into theInternational Air & Space Hall of Fameat theSan Diego Air & Space Museum.[65]
In 2019, Congress passed the Christa McAuliffe Commemorative Coin Act which was signed into law by PresidentDonald Trumpon October 9, 2019. The bill allows theDepartment of the Treasuryto "issue not more than 350,000 $1 silver coins in commemoration of Christa McAuliffe." Thecoins were mintedin 2021.[66][67][68][69][70][71][72]
On September 2, 2024 - McAuliffe's 76th birthday - a statue of the astronaut was unveiled at theNew Hampshire State Capitol. The statue, sculpted by artistBenjamin Victor, is the first statue of a woman on the state house grounds. Inscribed on the side of the statue's pedestal is a quote from McAuliffe: "I touch the future, I teach".[73]
The documentaryChrista: From Ordinary to ExtraordinarybyNew Hampshire PBSlooks at her life in new Hampshire and Concord, with people she knew talking about what she wanted for students to know about the role of women in history.[74]
