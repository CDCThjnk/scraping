Jeffrey Alan Hoffman(born November 2, 1944) is an American formerNASAastronautand currently a professor of aeronautics and astronautics at theMassachusetts Institute of Technology.
Hoffman made five flights as aSpace Shuttleastronaut, including the first mission to repair theHubble Space Telescopein 1993, when the orbiting telescope's flawed optical system was corrected.[1]Trained as an astrophysicist, he also flew on the 1990 Spacelab Shuttle mission that featured the Astro-1 ultraviolet astronomical observatory in the Shuttle's payload bay. Over the course of his five missions he logged more than 1,211 hours and 21.5 million miles in space. He was also NASA's secondJewishastronaut, and the second Jewish man in space after Soviet cosmonautBoris Volynov.[2]

Background
Hoffman was born November 2, 1944, inBrooklyn,New York, but considersScarsdale, New York, to be his hometown. He graduated fromScarsdale High Schoolin 1962, received aBAdegree (summa cum laude) inastronomyfromAmherst Collegein 1966,[3]aPhDdegree inastrophysicsfromHarvard Universityin 1971,[4]and anMScdegree inmaterials sciencefromRice Universityin 1988.[5][2]Hoffman is anEagle Scout.
Hoffman is a member of theInternational Academy of Astronautics, theInternational Astronomical Union, theAmerican Institute of Aeronautics and Astronautics, theAmerican Astronomical Society, theSpanish Academy of Engineering,Phi Beta Kappa, andSigma Xi.
As of 2005[update]he is co-director of the Massachusetts Space Grant Consortium and a professor of the Practice in the Department of Aeronautics and Astronautics atMIT.

Academic experience
Hoffman's original research interests were in high-energy astrophysics, specificallycosmicgamma rayandx-rayastronomy. His doctoral work at Harvard was the design, construction, testing, and flight of aballoon-borne, low-energy, gamma raytelescope.
From 1972 to 1975, during post-doctoral work at theUniversity of Leicesterin the United Kingdom, he worked on several x-ray astronomyrocketpayloads. He also designed and supervised the construction and testing of the test equipment for use in an x-ray beam facility which he used to measure the scattering and reflectivity properties of x-ray concentratingmirrors. During his last year at Leicester, he was project scientist for the medium-energy x-ray experiment on theEuropean Space Agency'sEXOSATsatelliteand played a leading role in the proposal and design studies for this project.
He worked in theCenter for Space Researchat theMassachusetts Institute of Technology(MIT) from 1975 to 1978 as project scientist in charge of the orbitingHEAO-1A4 hard x-ray and gamma ray experiment, launched in August 1977. 
His involvement included pre-launch design of the data analysis system, supervising its operation post-launch, and directing the MIT team undertaking the scientific analysis of flight data being returned. He was also involved extensively in analysis of x-ray data from the SAS-3 satellite being operated by MIT. His principal research was the study of x-ray bursts, about which he authored or co-authored more than 20 papers.[2]
He joined the MIT Aeronautics and Astronautics faculty in 2001 as a senior lecturer, and since 2002 has been a professor of the Practice in that department. His research specialties include human space flight operations, space flight technology, human-machine interactions, extravehicular activity, and conducting laboratory research in space. His teaching interests include space systems design and space policy.[6]Dr. Hoffman instructed a course in systems engineering on the space shuttle that is available for free in video format from academic earth.

NASA experience
Selected by NASA in January 1978, Hoffman became an astronaut in August 1979. During preparations for the Shuttle Orbital Flight Tests, he worked in the Flight Simulation Laboratory atDowney, California, testingguidance,navigationand flight control systems. He worked with the orbital maneuvering and reaction control systems, with Shuttle navigation, with crew training, and with the development of satellite deployment procedures. Hoffman served as a support crewmember forSTS-5and as a CAPCOM (spacecraft communicator) for theSTS-8andSTS-82missions. He also worked on EVA, including the development of a high-pressurespacesuit, and preparations for the assembly of theSpace Station. Hoffman was a co-founder of the Astronaut Office Science Support Group. In 1996 he led the Payload and Habitability Branch of the Astronaut Office.
Among theJewish itemshe took into space were aDreidel, which he spun for an hour, aMezuzah, which he attached to the space station bunk bed he and fellow Jewish astronautScott J. Horowitzalternately used, and aHanukkahmenorah.[7][1]
Hoffman left the astronaut program in July 1997 to become NASA's European Representative inParis, where he served until August 2001. His principal duties were to keep NASA and NASA's European partners informed about each other's activities, try to resolve problems in US-European cooperative space projects, search for new areas of US-European space cooperation, and represent NASA in European media. In August 2001, Hoffman was seconded by NASA to the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, where he is a professor in the Department of Aeronautics and Astronautics. He is engaged in several research projects using theInternational Space Stationand teaches courses on space operations and design.[2]

Space flight experience
 - STS 51-D(April 12–19, 1985)
 - STS-35(December 2–10, 1990)
 - STS-46(July 31 – August 8, 1992)
 - STS-61(December 2–13, 1993)
 - STS-75(February 22 – March 9, 1996)
Hoffman made his first space flight as a mission specialist onSTS 51-D, April 12–19, 1985, on theSpace ShuttleDiscovery. On this mission, he made the first STS contingency spacewalk, in an attempted rescue of a malfunctioning satellite.
Hoffman made his second space flight as a mission specialist onSTS-35, December 2–10, 1990, on theSpace ShuttleColumbia. This Spacelab mission featured the ASTRO-1ultravioletastronomy laboratory, a project on which Hoffman had worked since 1982.
Hoffman made his third space flight as payload commander and mission specialist onSTS-46, July 31 – August 8, 1992, on theSpace ShuttleAtlantis. On this mission, the crew deployed the European Retrievable Carrier (EURECA), an ESA-sponsored free-flying science platform, and carried out the first test flight of the Tethered Satellite System (TSS), a joint project between NASA and theItalian Space Agency. Hoffman had worked on the Tethered Satellite project since 1987.
Hoffman made his fourth flight as an EVA crewmember onSTS-61, December 2–13, 1993, on theSpace ShuttleEndeavour. During this flight, theHubble Space Telescope(HST) was captured, serviced, and restored to full capacity through a record five spacewalks by four astronauts, including Hoffman. Hoffman also spun adreidelfor the holiday ofHanukkahto a live audience watching via satellite.[1]
Hoffman last flew onSTS-75(February 22 – March 9, 1996) on the Space ShuttleColumbia. This was a 16-day mission whose principal payloads were the reflight of the Tethered Satellite System (TSS) and the third flight of the United StatesMicrogravityPayload (USMP-3). The TSS successfully demonstrated the ability of tethers to produce electricity. The TSS experiment produced a wealth of new information on theelectrodynamicsof tethers andplasma physicsbefore the tether broke at 19.7 km, just shy of the 20.7 km goal. The crew also worked around the clock performing combustion experiments and research related to USMP-3 microgravity investigations. During this mission, Hoffman became the first astronaut to log 1000 hours aboard the Space Shuttle.[2]Hoffman took with him a small Torah scroll, and he read from theBook of Genesisduring the flight. The documentary film "Space Torah" released in 2023, is centered around this event.[8]
With the completion of his fifth space flight, Dr. Hoffman has logged more than 1,211 hours and 21.5 million miles in space.

After NASA
Since 2002, he has been a professor of the Practice in the Department of Aeronautics and Astronautics at theMassachusetts Institute of Technology.
Since 2008 he has also been a visiting professor at the Department of Physics and Astronomy at the University of Leicester.
He is the author of a book titledAn Astronaut's DiaryISBN978-0-936897-00-4(June 1986) which is accompanied by a cassette tape.  The audio tape contains excerpts of the original recordings he made with a pocket tape recorder.
Hoffman is a visiting lecturer at theInternational Space University.
