Edward Tsang"Ed"Lu(Chinese:盧傑;pinyin:Lú Jié; born July 1, 1963) is an Americanphysicistand formerNASAastronaut. He flew on threeSpace Shuttleflights, and made an extended stay aboard theInternational Space Station.[1]
In 2007, Lu retired from NASA to become theprogram managerofGoogle'sAdvanced Projects Team.[2][3]In 2002, while still at NASA, Lu co-founded theB612 Foundation, dedicated to protecting the Earth fromasteroid strikes, later serving as itschairman.[1]As of 2020, he is its executive director.[4]

Early life and education
Lu was born inSpringfield, Massachusetts,[5]to aTaiwanese Americanfamily.[6]His parents were immigrants fromTaiwan.[7]He was raised inHonolulu, Hawaii, andWebster, New York.[5]
Lu attended R. L. Thomas High School, where he was a member of the wrestling team and graduated in 1980. After high school, Lu graduated fromCornell University, where he earned hisBachelor of Science(B.S.) inelectrical engineeringand was a member ofPi Kappa Phi. He then earned aMaster of Science(M.S.) and aPh.D.inapplied physicsfromStanford Universityin 1989 as a fellow of theNational Science Foundation.[1]
Lu became a specialist insolar physicsand did postdoctoral work at theInstitute for AstronomyinHonolulu, Hawaiibefore being selected for theNASA Astronaut Corpsin 1994.[1]

NASA career
Lu flew onSpace ShuttlemissionsSTS-84in 1997 andSTS-106in 2000, in which he carried out a six-hour spacewalk to perform construction work on the International Space Station. Having been flight engineer onSoyuz TMA-2, Lu spent six months in space in 2003 as part ofISS Expedition 7, with cosmonautYuri Malenchenko.[1]
In July 2003, Lu and Malenchenko answered questions from students participating in Japan'sNASDAspecial educational event, where Ed Lu performed "Happy Birthday" on an electronic piano for a student's birthday in the live broadcast from space.[8][9]He had demonstrated the difficulty of playing the piano instrument in space during a live in-orbit interview with CBS News and NASA TV video feed.[10]Also on this ISS mission on October 15, 2003, Lu communicated with the crewman of China's first crewed mission into space,Yang Liwei, flying aboardShenzhou 5. Lu congratulated the Chinese for the achievement and said inPutonghua: "Welcome to space. Have a safe journey". Malenchenko added: "I love to have somebody else in space instead of (just) me and Ed".[11]
During theSTS-106mission, while on a space phone call with professorLloyd Kaufman, Ed Lu observed that there is nomoon illusionin space[12]
While still employed at NASA, Lu co-founded theB612 Foundationalong with former astronautRusty Schweickartand scientists Clark Chapman andPiet Hut.  It has conducted two lines of related research to help detect asteroids that could one day strike the Earth, and find the technological means for asteroid deflection. The foundation's current goal is to design and build a privately financed asteroid-finding space telescope, Sentinel, to be launched in 2017–2018. The Sentinel's infrared telescope, once parked in an orbit similar to that of Venus, will help identify asteroids and other near-Earth objects (NEOs) that pose a risk of collision with Earth.[1]

Magic trick in space
While on the ISS, Lu teamed up with magicianJames Randi(founder ofJREF) to perform a card trick in outer space.  Randi asked Lu to (without looking) select a card from the middle of a brand new freshly shuffled deck of cards, turn it around and reinsert the card into the deck the opposite direction.  Then place the deck of cards back into its box then take them out again and fan the cards to the camera. This same procedure was being done by Randi back on Earth at the JREF headquarters in front of witnesses from the Miami Herald.  Both Randi and Lu successfully selected the same card, the seven of diamonds.  The remaining cards were jettisoned for weight reasons before returning to Earth, but Lu smuggled the card home.  The two cards complete with autographs are framed for public view at the JREF offices in Fort Lauderdale, FL.  Randi asks Lu "What are the odds that we would both choose the same card?" Lu answers "Knowing you and your tricky ways, the odds were one in one, because it's a trick!"[13]

Post-NASA career
On August 10, 2007, Lu announced he was retiring from NASA to work atGoogle.[1][2]
In June 2010, Lu left Google and worked out of the Sunfire Offices.[14]In September 2011, Lu joinedLiquid Roboticsas Chief of Innovative Applications, where his work includes outreach to promote new applications for ocean science,[15]and in 2012, he joined Hover Inc. as its Chief Technology Officer.[16]
On June 28, 2012, Lu, with Apollo 9 AstronautRusty SchweickartandG. Scott Hubbard, Astronautics professor atStanford Universityannounced plans to build and operate the firstprivately-funded deep space mission calledSentinel. Their non-profitB612 Foundationwill launch aninfraredspace telescopein orbit around the Sun, where from a distance as great as 270,000,000 kilometers (170,000,000 mi) from Earth, where it would detect and track asteroids and othernear-Earth objectsposing threats to the planet. On October 25, 2016, B612 and Lu endorsed NASA's NEOcam proposed mission and ended the Sentinel project.
As of 2022, Lu is working on a new project to find "killer asteroids" by analyzing terabytes of archived data. So far, theB612 Foundation, cofounded by Lu, has found over 100 new potentially-threatening asteroids. This immense number-crunching effort is supported in part by Google's applied artificial intelligence project.[17]

Lu is married and has two children.
