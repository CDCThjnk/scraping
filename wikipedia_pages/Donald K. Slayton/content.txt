Donald Kent"Deke"Slayton(March 1, 1924 – June 13, 1993) was an AmericanAir Forcepilot,aeronautical engineer,test pilot, and one of the originalNASAMercury Sevenastronauts. He went on to become NASA's firstChief of the Astronaut Officeand Director of Flight Crew Operations, responsible for NASA crew assignments.
Slayton joined theU.S. Army Air ForcesduringWorld War II, and flew inEuropeand thePacific. He left the Army after World War II, went on to receive aBachelor of Sciencedegree inaeronautical engineeringfromUniversity of Minnesotain 1949, and later joined theMinnesota Air National Guardafter working forBoeingas anaeronautical engineer.  He joined theUnited States Air Force, and attended theU.S. Air Force Test Pilot Schoolin 1955. In 1959, he applied to, and was selected as one of theMercury Seven, NASA's first class of astronauts. Slayton was scheduled to pilot the second U.S. crewedorbital spaceflight, but was grounded in 1962 byatrial fibrillation, an irregular heart rhythm.  In March 1972, he was medically cleared to fly and was the docking module pilot of the 1975Apollo–Soyuz Test Project(ASTP). Slayton continued to work at NASA until 1982. He also helped develop theSpace Shuttle.
Slayton died frombrain canceron June 13, 1993, aged 69.

Early life and career
Donald Kent Slayton was born on March 1, 1924, on a farm nearLeon, Wisconsin, to Charles Sherman Slayton (1887–1972) and Victoria Adelia Slayton (néeLarson; 1895–1970).[1][2]: 9He was ofEnglishandNorwegiandescent.  From a young age, he worked on the farm to raise sheep and cows, and grow tobacco.  Throughout Slayton's childhood, his family's home did not have electricity or indoor plumbing. At the age of five, Slayton was clearing a horse-drawn hay mower when his left ring finger was severed.[2]: 10–15He attended a two-room elementary school in Leon, and graduated fromSparta High Schoolin 1942, where heboxed, playedtrombone, and was active in theFuture Farmers of America(FFA).[2]: 15–17

World War II
The 1941attack on Pearl Harborby theEmpire of Japanoccurred during Slayton's senior year of high school.  He initially wished to join theU.S. Navy, but joined theU.S. Army Air Forceswhen it began accepting high school graduates to fly.[2]: 17[note 1]After graduation, Slayton moved toSan Antonio, Texas, and entered theAviation Cadet Training Program.  He was initially medically delayed because of his severed ring finger, but was deemed able to fly.  Slayton began flight training inVernon, Texas, where he trained on theFairchild PT-19, thePT-17 Stearman, and theAT-6 Texan. After three months of primary training, Slayton moved toWaco, Texas, for basic flight training, where he flew theBT-13 Valiant. Despite Slayton's wishes to fly single-engine fighter aircraft, he was selected to fly multi-engine aircraft. Slayton began multi-engine training on theBeechcraft AT-10,Cessna AT-17, and theCurtiss AT-9. Slayton graduated from flight training on April 22, 1943, and was assigned to fly on theB-25 Mitchell, his last choice for aircraft.[2]: 18–22
Slayton moved toColumbia Army Air BaseinSouth Carolinafor the three-month-long B-25 Mitchell training. After completing training, he was assigned to the340th Bombardment Group, and departed for theEuropean theater of operationson ship fromNewport News, Virginia. After a stop in Zerni, North Africa, his convoy traveled toNaples, Italy. While traveling near theStrait of Gibraltar, their ships came under attack from German bombers andsubmarines.[2]: 23–24After he arrived in Naples, the 340th Bombardment Group moved to San Petrazio, where Slayton flew combat missions into theBalkan Peninsula. After six weeks, he moved toFoggia, where 48 aircraft were destroyed after an eruption ofMount Vesuvius.  Afterwards, Slayton flew out ofSalernoandCorsica, where he upgraded from copilot to pilot. After 56 combat sorties, Slayton completed his combat tour and returned to the U.S. in May 1944.[2]: 26–32
Immediately upon his return to Columbia Army Air Base to serve as a B-25 instructor, Slayton applied and was accepted to fly the newA-26 Invaderbomber aircraft. He moved toSelfridge FieldinMichiganfor training, and began preparing for a deployment to thePacific. In July 1945, he arrived onOkinawa Islandand joined the319th Bombardment Group. He flew seven combat missions overJapan, and encountered little Japanese resistance. Slayton flew his final combat mission on August 12, three days after thebombing of Nagasakiand spent two months waiting for his return to the U.S. After the war, Slayton worked as B-25 instructor inAlbany, Georgia, andBoca Raton, Floridaand separated from the Army in November 1946.[2]: 33–40[3]

Post-World War II
After he was discharged from the Army, Slayton enrolled at theUniversity of Minnesota, inMinneapolis, and studiedaeronautical engineering.  As a student, he supported himself using theGI Billand by working at aMontgomery Wardwarehouse.  He graduated with aBachelor of Sciencedegree in 1949, and accepted a job as an engineer with theBoeing Aircraft CorporationatSeattle, Washington.[4]After moving to Seattle, Slayton lived in a rooming house and began working as a junior design engineer. While at Boeing, he worked on theB-52 Stratofortressand theKC-97 Stratofreighter.[2]: 40–47
While he was a college student, Slayton joined theAir Force Reserve, and was a T-6 Texan pilot flying out ofMinneapolis–Saint Paul International Airport. He transitioned to theMinnesota Air National Guard(ANG), after accepting a demotion from captain to second lieutenant, to allow him to fly the A-26 Invader andP-51 Mustang. He left the Minnesota ANG when he moved to Seattle. Slayton attempted to join an Air Force Reserve unit in Seattle at the start of theKorean War, but was rejected on the grounds that his inactive reserve status had expired. He contacted his previous squadron commander in Minnesota and accepted his offer to rejoin his former squadron in February 1951. Upon his return, Slayton was initially medically disqualified from flying for his eyesight. He served as a maintenance officer while waiting for his medical clearance and then became a maintenance flight test officer once he had returned to flying status.[2]: 40–49
In 1952, Slayton transferred to active duty Air Force from the Air National Guard. After completing his education atAir Command and Staff School, he was assigned as a maintenance inspector atTwelfth Air ForceHeadquarters inWiesbaden Army Airfield,West Germany. He additionally served as anF-86 Sabrepilot and maintenance officer with the36th Fighter Day WingatBitburg Air Base,West Germany.  While stationed in Germany, he met Marjorie Lunney and married her on May 18, 1955.[3][2]: 52–54
At the start of his assignment in West Germany, Slayton applied to theU.S. Air Force Test Pilot School(TPS), but was rejected on the basis that he had to complete his current three-year assignment. He reapplied and was accepted in 1955, and joined TPS Class 55C. After graduating in December 1955, he became atest pilotat theFlight Test CenteratEdwards Air Force Base,California. He tested theF-101,F-102,F-104,F-105andF-106.[5]He was first assigned to the F-102, and tested theMatadorandGeniemissiles, and later tested the stall-spin characteristics of the F-105.[6]In 1958, he helped test Britain's first supersonic fighter, theEnglish Electric P1B Lightning.[2]: 55–65

NASA career

Mercury Seven
In January 1959, Slayton was selected as one of the candidates forNASA'sProject Mercury, the first U.S. crewed space flight program. Despite his initial lack of interest in spaceflight, he agreed to pursue astronaut selection. After an initial interview at the temporary NASA headquarters in theDolley Madison HouseinWashington, D.C., Slayton was psychologically and physically tested at theLovelace ClinicinAlbuquerque, New Mexico, along with fellow future astronautsScott CarpenterandJim Lovell. On April 2, 1959, Slayton was notified of his selection as an astronaut. He moved his family from Edwards Air Force Base to a housing development nearFort Eustis, where he was neighbors with fellowMercury SevenastronautsGus GrissomandWally Schirra.[1][2]: 66, 69–75
After he began at NASA, Slayton was assigned to the development of theConvairAtlas LV-3B.[7]: 98In 1959, during acentrifugetraining course, he underwent anelectrocardiogramthat found that he had erratic heart activity. He received further medical evaluation atBrooks Air Force Baseand was diagnosed withidiopathicatrial fibrillation, but he was considered healthy enough to continue flying.[2]: 78–79, 85–86During the uncrewedMercury-Atlas 4orbital spaceflight, he worked at the tracking station inBermuda. He was selected for the second American crewed orbital mission,Mercury-Atlas 7, which he intended to nameDelta 7.[2]: 104–105, 110In early 1962, NASA AdministratorJames Webbopened an investigation into Slayton's atrial fibrillation. On March 15, 1962, two months prior to the launch ofDelta 7, Slayton was medically disqualified from the flight and replaced on the mission byScott Carpenter.[2]: 111–114[8][9]Initially, Slayton's ineligibility was only for his assigned mission, and he attempted to improve his health by exercising more regularly and abstaining from alcohol. NASA leadership determined that Slayton was still at risk for atrial fibrillation and removed his eligibility to fly any of the remaining Mercury missions.[2]: 115–116[3]Flight doctors recommended acardiac catheterizationto determine if he had a congenital condition, but NASA management rejected the proposal because of the risks of the operation.[9]

NASA management
After being grounded by NASA, Slayton was selected in early 1962 to serve as the senior manager of the astronaut office. One of his first roles was to select theGroup 2astronauts, and the new class was announced in September 1962. Additionally, he was tasked with making future crew assignments, and assignedGordon CoopertoMercury-Atlas 9.[2]: 115–122In an administrative restructuring in October 1963, Slayton became assistant director of Flight Crew Operations, in addition to his job managing the astronaut office. In November 1963, he resigned from his commission in the Air Force after he was permanently disqualified from flying and became a civilian executive for NASA. AfterAlan Shepardwas grounded due toMénière's disease, he replaced Slayton as the manager of the astronaut office, while Slayton continued to work for Flight Crew Operations and was promoted to its director in 1966.[10][2]: 133–140[11]Slayton continued to be responsible for making crew assignments, and determined the astronauts that would fly on theGeminiandApollomissions.[2]: 166–168, 184Slayton created a crew rotation, where a crew would be selected as the backup crew for a mission and would later be the prime crew three missions later.[12]: 42
During theApollo 1 fire, Slayton was in theCape Canaveral LC-34blockhouse. He was a close friend of fellow astronaut Gus Grissom and had considered working inside the capsule to determine communications problems and would have worked under the footrests, where the fire would later begin.[12]: 16–17[2]: 185, 189After the fire, Slayton called a meeting of the astronauts from the first groups to be chosen, in April 1967 and announced that they were the candidates for the first lunar landing.[12]: 27Slayton oversaw the crew reassignments for the upcoming Apollo missions, as well as the selection forGroup 6andGroup 7astronauts. During this time, he continued to show symptoms of atrial fibrillation. After NASA Administrator James Webb decided thatApollo 8would become a circumlunar mission, Slayton switched the previous crew to theApollo 9because of their experience with thelunar moduleand moved both the prime and backup crew from Apollo 9 to Apollo 8. Due to his crew rotation schedule, the backup crew ofNeil Armstrong,Buzz AldrinandMichael Collinsbecame the primary crew forApollo 11.[2]: 200–203, 223–224, 250[12]: 58–62, 136–137Slayton continued to assign the crew for the remaining lunar landings.  Slayton chose to replaceKen MattinglywithJack SwigertonApollo 13, after concerns arose that Mattingly could developrubelladuring the mission.[12]: 288In 1969, he made the controversial decision to assign Alan Shepard as theApollo 13commander, which was viewed by some astronauts as a conflict of interest, due to Shepard's previous position as head of the astronaut office. Shepard would be later reassigned to commandApollo 14, against Slayton's wishes, by the Office of Manned Spaceflight directorGeorge Mueller, who felt that Shepard needed additional training time.[12]: 346–348After thepostal covers scandalduring theApollo 15mission, Slayton reassigned the crew to non-flying jobs, effectively ending their astronaut careers.[12]: 496–497Slayton supported keepingJoe Engleas the lunar module pilot onApollo 17, but was pressured by NASA management to replace him withJack Schmitt, a scientist-astronaut.[2]: 271[12]: 450–451

Return to flight status
While grounded, Slayton took several measures to attempt to be restored to flight status, including regularly exercising, taking vitamins, quitting cigarette smoking and coffee and reducing his consumption of alcoholic beverages. In 1970 his palpitations became more frequent and he started taking experimental daily doses ofquinidine, a crystalline alkaloid. This treatment was successful, but concerned that taking medication would still disqualify him from solo flying, Slayton stopped taking it against doctors orders.[9]After a decade of seeing doctors around the world,[13]in 1971 Slayton was examined at theMayo Clinicafter a long period without heart fibrillation, and was determined to not have a coronary condition. On March 13, 1972, NASA announced that Slayton had returned to flight status.[2]: 264, 274, 275

Apollo–Soyuz flight
In February 1973, Slayton was assigned to theApollo–SoyuzTest Project (ASTP) as a docking module pilot, along with commanderThomas Staffordand command module pilotVance Brand. The American crew began a two-year training program, which included learning the Russian language and making trips to theYuri Gagarin Cosmonaut Training Centerin theUSSR. He remained in a managerial role throughout theSkylabprogram, and resigned as Director of Flight Crew Operations in February 1974 in preparation for his upcoming flight.[2]: 280–281, 290[1][14]: 160–166
The Apollo andSoyuzspacecraft both launched on July 15, 1975. On July 17, the two craft rendezvoused in orbit and the American astronauts conducted crew transfers with cosmonautsAlexei LeonovandValeri Kubasov. At the end of the flight, an erroneous switch setting led to noxiousnitrogen tetroxidefumes from the command module's RCS thrusters being sucked into the cabin during landing and the crew was hospitalized as a precaution inHonolulu,Hawaii, for two weeks. During hospitalization, alesionwas discovered on Slayton's lung and removed. It was determined to be benign, but he would have likely been grounded from ASTP if it had been discovered before the flight.[2]: 300–305[14]: 188–195He was 51 years old, making him the oldest astronaut to fly in space at the time.[10]

Space Shuttle program
Prior to the ASTP flight, Slayton was assigned byChris Kraftto manage theApproach and Landing Tests(ALT) of the Space Shuttle program. The ALT program developed the tests for theSpace Shuttle orbiterEnterprise, and modified severalF-104 StarfightersandT-38 Talonsto train the astronauts. While working on the Space Shuttle, he also assisted in developing theShuttle Carrier Aircraft.[1][2]: 306–312
The ALT program ended in late 1977 and Slayton agreed to manage the Space Shuttle's Orbital Flight Tests (OFT). During the selection of theGroup 8astronauts, Slayton advocated for fewer selections, with the expectation that two-man crews would fly the regular satellite deployment missions. He officially retired in 1980, but continued to serve in an advisory role forSTS-1, and flew a T-38 chase plane during the landing ofSTS-2. He formally left NASA on February 27, 1982, and had flown 7,164 hours.[1][2]: 310–323

Post-NASA career
After his retirement from NASA, Slayton served as president ofSpace Services Inc., a Houston-based company earlier founded to develop rockets for small commercial payloads. He served as mission director for a rocket called theConestoga, which was successfully launched on September 9, 1982, and was the world's first privately funded rocket to reach space.[15][2]: 329–342Slayton also became interested inaviation racing, and was President of International Formula One Pylon Air Racing andDirectorof Columbia Astronautics. He also served on theDepartment of Transportation's Commercial Space Advisory Committee.[1][2]: 323–328
In 1991, Slayton began working with space historianMichael Cassuttto write his autobiography, titledDeke!: U.S. Manned Space from Mercury to the Shuttle, which was published in 1994, a year after his death.[2]: 343Slayton also co-wrote the 1994 bookMoon Shot: The Inside Story of America's Race to the Moonwith fellow astronautAlan Shepard.[16]

Personal life
Slayton married Marjorie "Marge" Lunney (1921–1989) on May 18, 1955, and they had one son.[17]: 345They divorced in April 1978, and Slayton moved to a condominium near theJohnson Space Center.[2]: 308, 312He married Bobbie Belle Jones (1945–2010), who also worked at NASA, in October 1983, and they remained married until his death.[17]: 350[2]: 318
When Slayton was a test pilot, one of his pilot colleagues was also named Don. In order to avoid confusion in radio communications, Slayton was referred to by his initials, D.K., which were eventually shortened to "Deke."[2]: 58
In 1992, Slayton was diagnosed with a malignantbrain tumor. On June 13, 1993, he died in his home inLeague City, Texas, from the illness, at the age of 69.[18]Following his death, PresidentBill Clintonissued a statement of condolences stating Slayton "met adversity with determination, and discouragement with a dedication to never yield his dreams" and "his commitment to space exploration helped pull the world into an era of new possibilities that grows and expands to this day."[19]He was cremated and his ashes scattered over his family farm in Sparta, Wisconsin.[20]
