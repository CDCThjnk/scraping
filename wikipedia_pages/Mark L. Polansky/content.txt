Polansky retired from the Astronaut Corps on June 30, 2012.[6]"Mark is a remarkably talented individual," saidPeggy Whitson,Chief of the Astronaut Office. "His skills as an aviator coupled with his engineering expertise were a valuable contribution to our team. We wish him well in his future endeavors."[7]

Spaceflights

STS-98Atlantis(February 9–20, 2001)
The STS-98 crew continued the task of building and enhancing theInternational Space Stationby delivering the U.S.Destiny Laboratory Module. The Shuttle spent seven days docked to the station while Destiny was attached and three spacewalks were conducted to complete its assembly. The crew also relocated a docking port, and delivered supplies and equipment to the residentExpedition 1crew. Mission duration was 12 days, 21 hours, 20 minutes.[8]

STS-116Discovery(December 9–22, 2006)
The seven-member crew on this 12-day mission continued construction of the ISS outpost by adding theP5 Truss Segmentduring the first of four spacewalks. The next two spacewalks rewired the station's power system, preparing it to support the addition of European and Japanese science modules by future shuttle crews. The fourth spacewalk was added to allow the crew to coax and retract a stubborn solar panel to fold up accordion-style into its box. Discovery also delivered a new crew member and more than two tons of equipment and supplies to the station. Almost two tons of items no longer needed on the station returned to Earth with STS-116. Mission duration was 12 days, 20 hours and 45 minutes.[9]

STS-127Endeavour(July 15–31, 2009)
Polansky was the commander of theSTS-127mission, which launched aboardSpace Shuttle Endeavouron July 15, 2009, from the Kennedy Space Center in Florida. During this 16-day mission, the seven-member crew installed the Japanese Exposed Facility onto the ISS, and performed five spacewalks. Polansky returned to Earth with his crew on July 31, 2009.[10]Following fellow astronautMichael J. Massimino's lead, Mark began posting public updates and replies toTwitteron May 7, 2009, during his training for STS-127, and continued to do so throughout the mission.[11]

In his hometown of Edison, NJ, a park is named for him on Grove Ave., across the street from his alma mater ofJ. P. Stevens High School.[12]Recently in June 2006 the township officials unveiled a sign for Mark Polansky Park while his friends and family were there with him for this presentation. He frequently returns to Edison for programs at the local library for the kids.
