Spacewalks
On 14 January 2010 Surayev went outside the ISS into space with fellow Russian cosmonautOleg Kotovto begin his first spacewalk. The spacewalk started at 10:05 GMT when Surayev and Kotov, wearing new RussianOrlan-MKcomputerised spacesuits, floated out of thePirsDocking compartment airlock. The spacewalking duo connected cables between thePoiskandZvezdamodules, installed docking targets and Kurs aerials and attached additional handrails to exit hatches.[citation needed]They also retrieved a Russian biological experiment from the outside hull of the ISS and tossed out two big wads of space trash that contained unneeded insulation covers. The spacewalk lasted 5 hours and 44 minutes.[10]
Surayev and cosmonautAleksandr Samokutyaevperformed a spacewalk (Russian EVA-40) outside the space station on 22 October 2014.[11]Although planned as a six-hour spacewalk, the cosmonauts were able to complete all the scheduled tasks in 3 hours and 38 minutes. During theextravehicular activity, Surayev and Samokutyaev dismantled the RK 21-8 Radiometria science payload and the 2ASF1-1 and 2ASF1-2 KURS antennas from thePoiskmodule.[12]The RK-21-8 science payload was installed aboard the Space Station during the Russian EVA-28 in early 2011 and consisted of an antenna system with calibrator, a Microwave Radiometer receiver system and a Command-Information Unit. It was used for a series of seismic forecast and earthquake studies. The RK-21-8 payload was jettisoned by Surayev 33 minutes into the EVA on a safe departure trajectory from the Space Station. Surayev and Samokutyaev also released a protective cover from the EXPOSE-R payload developed by theEuropean Space Agencyto conduct astrobiology studies by exposing samples and experiments to the space environment. When the cosmonauts finished operations at thePoiskmodule, they photographed the surface of the orbital station for specialists to assess its condition later. Russian EVA-40 was the 184th spacewalk in support of the Space Station assembly.
