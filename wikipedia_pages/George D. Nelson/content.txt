His last research was in systemic education reform and the preparation of science teachers.[3]

NASA career
George was selected as an astronaut candidate by NASA in January 1978. He flew as a scientific equipment operator in theWB-57Fearth resources aircraft and served as theAstronaut Officerepresentative in the Space Shuttle Extravehicular Mobility Unit (space suit) development effort.

The mission also included flight testing ofManned Maneuvering Units(MMUs) in two extravehicular activities (EVAs), and operation of the Cinema 360 andIMAXCamera Systems. Nelson performed EVAs in support of the satellite retrieval and the MMU testing.[5]
This mission, from January 12–18, 1986, launched from theKennedy Space Centerand returned to a night landing atEdwards Air Force Base,California. During the six-day flight, the crew deployed theSATCOMKU satellite and conducted experiments inastrophysicsand materials processing.[6]
This mission (September 29–October 3, 1988) was the first flown after theChallengeraccident. During the four-day flight, the crew successfully deployed the Tracking and Data Relay Satellite (TDRS-C) and operated eleven mid-deck science experiments. The mission completed 64 orbits of the Earth and landed on October 3, 1988.[7]

Post-NASA career
Nelson left NASA in June 1989, became an assistantprovostat the University of Washington,[8]and now directs the Science, Mathematics and Technology Education program atWestern Washington UniversityinBellingham. He is also the principal investigator of the North Cascades and Olympic Science Partnership, a mathematics and science partnership grant from the National Science Foundation.[9]Nelson served as faculty on the Fall 2013Semester at Seavoyage, where he taught introductory astronomy and celestial navigation.[10]
