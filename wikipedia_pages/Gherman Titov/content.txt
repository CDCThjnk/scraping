Gherman[a]Stepanovich Titov(Russian:Герман Степанович Титов; 11 September 1935 – 20 September 2000) was a Soviet and Russiancosmonautwho, on 6 August 1961,[1]became the second human to orbit the Earth, aboardVostok 2, preceded byYuri GagarinonVostok 1. He was the fourth person in space, countingsuborbitalvoyages of US astronautsAlan ShepardandGus Grissom. A month short of 26 years old at launch, he is the youngest professional astronaut and was the youngest person to fly in space until 2021 whenOliver Daemenflew onBlue Origin NS-16at the age of 18.[2]Since Daemen flew a suborbital mission, Titov remains the youngest person to fly in Earth orbit.
Titov's flight finally proved that humans could live and work in space. He  was the first person to orbit the Earth multiple times (a total of 17), the first to pilot a spaceship and to spend more than a day in space. He was also the first to sleep in orbit and to suffer fromspace sickness(becoming the first person to vomit in space).[3]
Titov was the first human photographer in space:[4]he made the first manual photographs from orbit, thus setting a record for modernfirst photos of Earth from spaceby a human (the first picture of the planet from space was shot by aV-2 rocket in 1946, launched from New Mexico). He also was the first person to film the Earth using a professional quality Konvas-Avtomat movie camera, which he used for ten minutes.[5][6]
In his subsequent life Titov continued to work for theSoviet space program, and played a major role in theSpiral projectwhere he trained to become the first pilot of an orbitalspaceplane. However, after the death of Yuri Gagarin in a military aircraft accident in 1968, the Soviet government decided it could not afford to lose its second cosmonaut, and so Titov's career astest pilotended.
Titov served in theSoviet Air Force, attaining the rank ofcolonel-general. In his final years in post-Soviet Russia he became a Communist politician. Despite having been chosen second, after Gagarin, to fly into space, it was Titov who later proposed the Soviet Government regularly celebrateCosmonautics Dayon April 12, the day of Gagarin's flight.

Biography
Titov was born in the village ofVerkhneye Zhilinoin theAltai Kraiand went to school at the Stalingrad Military Aviation School. After graduating as an air force pilot, he was selected for cosmonaut training in 1960.
He flew theVostok 2mission launched on 6 August 1961. It lasted for 25.3 hours and he performed 17 orbits of the Earth. His call sign wasEagle(Russian:Орёл). He landed close to the town ofKrasny KutinSaratov Oblast, Russia. A month short of 26 years old at launch, he is the youngestAstronautand remained the youngest person to fly in space until July 2021, when his record was surpassed by a Dutch teenager,Oliver Daemen.[7][8]Titov was a member of theCommunist Party of the Soviet Union, as were almost all the Soviet cosmonauts.
Titov was a fine sportsman, and keen on gymnastics:
Service in the Air Force made us strong, both physically and morally. All of us cosmonauts took up sports and PT seriously when we served in the Air Force. I know thatYuri Gagarinwas fond ofice hockey. He liked to play goal keeper. Gherman Titov was agymnasticsenthusiast,Andriyan Nikolayevlikedskiing,Pavel Popovichwent in for weight lifting. I don't think I am wrong when I say that sports became a fixture in the life of the cosmonauts.
—Valery Bykovsky[9]
He was the first person to suffer fromspace sickness(motion sicknessin space) and was also the first person to sleep in space. He slept for roughly one orbit and was surprised to wake with his arms floating in the air because of the absence of normal gravity. He returned to sleep after he had his arms under a security belt and slept 30 minutes more than predicted by the flight plan. He stated, "Once you have your arms and legs arranged properly, space sleep is fine.... I slept like a baby".[10]
Though he had been suffering from space sickness during his orbit, Titov celebrated upon landing. His celebration is described as "a fit of euphoria" after landing, and on his return flight to Kubishev for debriefing, he alarmed the medical staff by opening and downing a beer, in complete violation of the rules.[11]
After landing, Titov was sent to hospital for further testing to ensure that he was not sick. After his mission, he reportedly engaged in behaviours that could be considered unacceptable for someone working within the space programme.[11]He is reported to have been enthralled in his love of women, excessive drinking, and fast cars, which caused some to theorise that his behaviour had potentially been another side effect of the space sickness he experienced fromzero gravity. Further testing revealed that not to be the case.[11]
During a widely-publicised 1962 visit to Seattle to tour theCentury 21 World's Fair, Titov was asked by reporters how his space flight affected his philosophy of life. He replied: "Sometimes people are saying that God is out there. I was looking around attentively all day but I didn't find anybody there. I saw neither angels nor God".[12]The utterance was used inSoviet anti-religion propaganda, but it was misattributed toYuri Gagarin.[13]
Following his space flight, Titov assumed various senior positions in the Soviet space programme until his retirement in 1992. In 1995, he was elected to theState Dumaas a member of theCommunist Party of the Russian Federation.
On 20 September 2000, he died ofcardiac arrestin his sauna at the age of 65 inMoscow.[14][15]He was buried in theNovodevichy Cemetery.

Cultural references
InArthur C. Clarke's 1982 book,2010: Odyssey Two(and the 1984 film adaptation2010), the opening scene features a conversation between Dimitri Moisevitch of the Soviet Space Council and Dr.Heywood Floyd. When Moisevitch informs Floyd that the Soviets will be travelling toJupiteron their new spaceship theCosmonautAlexei Leonov, Floyd is puzzled, expecting that the ship was to be named after Gherman Titov. In the book, Moisevitch just mentions that it has been changed toLeonov; in the film, he comments without elaboration that Titov has fallen out of favour.
BBC Radio 4'sAfternoon Playon 12 April 2011,Titanium, features Titov as narrator during the training and flight of Yuri Gagarin. It was part of a week to celebrate the 50th anniversary of Gagarin's flight.
