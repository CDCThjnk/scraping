Robert "Bob" Brent Thirsk,OCOBC(born August 17, 1953) is aCanadianretired engineer and physician, and a formerCanadian Space Agencyastronaut.  He holds the Canadian record for the most time spent in space (204 days, 18 hours and 29 minutes). He became an officer of theOrder of Canada(OC) in 2013 and was named to theOrder of British Columbia(OBC) in 2012.

Life
Thirsk is fromNew Westminster, British Columbiaand is married to Brenda Biasutti ofMontreal,Quebec. They have three children.[2]He enjoys spending time with his family, as well asflying,hockey,squash, and playing thepiano.
He is a member ofProfessional Engineers Ontario, theCollege of Family Physicians of Canada, theCanadian Aeronautics and Space Institute, theAerospace Medical Association, theCollege of Physicians and Surgeons of Ontario, and theInternational Space University.[3]
He won the Association of Professional Engineers, Geologists and Geophysicists of Alberta Gold Medal in 1976, and was the first recipient of the University of Calgary Distinguished Alumni Award (1985). In 1997, he was awarded the Gold Medal of the Professional Engineers of Ontario and was awarded honorary membership in theCollege of Physicians and Surgeons of British Columbia.[3]

Education
Thirsk attended primary and secondary schools inBritish Columbia,Alberta, andManitoba, attending Glenayre Elementary School[4][5](Port Moody, B.C.),R. T. Alderman Junior Highand graduating from Calgary'sLord Beaverbrook High School. His post-secondary education began with receiving aBachelor of Sciencedegree inmechanical engineeringfrom theUniversity of Calgaryin 1976, and continued with aMaster of Sciencedegree in mechanical engineering fromMITin 1978, anM.D.fromMcGill Universityin 1982, and hisMBAfrom theMIT Sloan School of Managementin 1998 as aSloan Fellow. He received anhonorary doctoratefrom the University of Calgary while in orbit on July 8, 2009. Fellow ISS crewmemberKoichi Wakataplaced the convocation cape on Thirsk, which was later removed due to it constantly floating up to his face.[6]This event made Thirsk the first person to receive a university degree from space.[7]In 2019, Thirsk was awarded an honoraryD.Eng.fromCarleton Universityin recognition of his outstanding career as a Canadian astronaut, his many contributions to scientific and health research, and his promotion of science education and lifelong learning.[8]

CSA career
Thirsk was in thefamily medicineresidency program at the Queen Elizabeth Hospital in Montreal when he was selected in December 1983 by theNational Research Council of Canadato join the Canadian astronaut program. He began astronaut training in February 1984 and served as backup payload specialist toMarc Garneaufor space shuttle missionSTS-41-G, which flew October 5 to 13, 1984.  He has participated in several parabolic flight experiment campaigns on board NASA'sKC-135aircraft and has been involved in various projects relating tospace medicine, theInternational Space Station, mission planning, and education with theCanadian Space Agency. He led an international research team investigating the effect of weightlessness on the heart and blood vessels. His team designed and tested an experimental "anti-gravity suit" that may help astronauts withstand the effects of extended spaceflight on thecardiovascular system.
He served as Chief Astronaut of the Canadian Space Agency in 1993 and 1994. In February 1994, he was crew commander for the CAPSULS mission, a simulated 7-day space mission that involved the participation of several international investigators and three other Canadian astronauts. In 1994–95, Thirsk completed a sabbatical year inVictoria, British Columbia. During this year, he improved his skills in clinical practice, space medicine research andRussian languagetraining.
On June 20, 1996, Thirsk flew aboard space shuttle missionSTS-78(the life and microgravitySpacelabmission) as a payload specialist. During this 17-day flight aboard theSpace ShuttleColumbia, he and his six crewmates performed 43 experiments devoted to the study of life andmaterials science. Most of these experiments were conducted within the pressurized Spacelab laboratory module situated in the orbiter's payload bay. The life science experiments investigated changes inplants,animalsandhumansunder spaceflight conditions. The materials science experiments examinedproteincrystallization,fluid dynamics, and high-temperature solidification of multi-phase materials inmicrogravity.
While on STS-78, Thirsk wrote two columns for theCalgary Sunnewspaper. This was the first occasion in which an astronaut wrote and filed a story to a newspaper—and had it published—while the astronaut was still in orbit.
In 1998, Thirsk was assigned by the Canadian Space Agency to NASA's Johnson Space Center in Houston to pursue mission specialist training. This training program involves advanced instruction on both shuttle and space station systems, EVA (spacewalking), robotic operations, and Russian language. Within the NASA Astronaut Office, Thirsk served as a CapCom (capsule communicator) for the International Space Station (ISS) program. CapComs participate in actual and simulated space missions as a communication link between the ground team at Mission Control and the astronauts in orbit. CapComs speak directly with the space station crew, and assist with technical planning for the mission and last-minute troubleshooting.
In October 2004, Thirsk served as the commander of theNEEMO 7mission aboard theAquariusunderwater laboratory, living and working underwater for eleven days.[9][10]As a back-up crewmember, Thirsk replaced fellow CSA astronautDafydd Williams, who had previously served as anaquanauton theNEEMO 1mission, due to Williams undergoing review of a temporary medical issue.[11][12][13]Williams eventually served as the commander ofNEEMO 9in April 2006.[14]
In 2004, Thirsk trained at theYuri Gagarin Cosmonaut Training Centrenear Moscow and became certified as a flight engineer for the Soyuz spacecraft. He served as backup flight engineer to European Space Agency (ESA) astronautRoberto Vittorifor theSoyuz TMA-6taxi mission to the ISS in April 2005. During the ten-day mission, Thirsk worked as Crew Interface Coordinator (European CapCom) at the Columbus Control Centre in Germany.
Thirsk was a member of theExpedition 21crew on the International Space Station. He launched as a flight engineer on theSoyuz TMA-15Soyuz mission on May 27, 2009, as a member of theExpedition 20crew. He was the first Canadian astronaut to fly on a Soyuz. About this mission, Thirsk is quoted saying "It will be the supreme thrill of my life. Throughout the mission I will examine the long-term effects of zero gravity as both a test subject and a physician. My findings will undoubtedly contribute to the future understanding of space station living."[15]He returned to Earth on Soyuz TMA-15 in November 2009.[16]
During the ISS 20/21 flight, he was visited by two other Canadians:Julie Payette(Space Shuttle EndeavourSTS 127) andspace touristGuy LalibertéonSoyuz TMA-16at the end of September 2009. The meeting between Thirsk and Payette in July 2009 was the first time two Canadians met in space.[17]He and the Soyuz TMA-15 crew returned to Earth December 1, 2009.
On April 12, 2011, Thirsk was awarded the RussianMedal "For Merit in Space Exploration"– for outstanding contribution to the development of international cooperation in crewed space flight. In 2012, he was made a Member of theOrder of British Columbia[18]and in 2013 he was made an Officer of theOrder of Canada[19]

Post-CSA career
From August 2012 to February 2014, Thirsk worked for theCanadian Institutes of Health Researchas Vice President, Public, Government and Institute Affairs. The institute is the Canadian government's health research investment agency.[20]
In September 2013, a Senior High School inCalgary,Albertaopened honoring Thirsk, namedRobert Thirsk High School.
Thirsk became Chancellor of theUniversity of Calgaryon July 1, 2014.[21]
In 2021 Robert made a trip to the UK where he gave a speech to Loughborough Grammar School.
