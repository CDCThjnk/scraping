She was stationed atMCAS Yuma,Arizona, and assigned as Flight Surgeon Marine Attack Squadron 211 (VMA-211), a Marine CorpsAV-8B Harriersquadron. Clark made several deployments, including one overseas to the Western Pacific, practiced medicine in austere environments, and flew on multiple aircraft. Her squadron won the Marine Attack Squadron of the Year award for its successful deployment. Clark was then assigned as the Group Flight Surgeon forMarine Aircraft Group 13(MAG-13).
Before her selection as an astronaut candidate, Clark served as a Flight Surgeon for Training Squadron 86 (VT-86), theNaval Flight Officeradvanced training squadron for tactical jets at NAS Pensacola.

NASA career
Selected by NASA in April 1996, Clark reported to theJohnson Space CenterinHouston, Texas, in August 1996.[5]After completing two years of training and evaluation, she was qualified for flight assignment as a mission specialist. From July 1997 to August 2000, Clark worked in the Astronaut Office Payloads/Habitability Branch. She flew aboardSTS-107, logging 15 days, 22 hours and 21 minutes in space.[4][6]

Space flight experience
STS-107Columbia– The 16-day flight was a dedicated science and research mission. Working 24 hours a day, in two alternating shifts, the crew successfully conducted approximately 80 experiments. Clark's bioscience experiments included gardening in space, as she discussed only days before her death in an interview withMilwaukeemedia near her Wisconsin hometown. The STS-107 mission ended abruptly on February 1, 2003, whenColumbiadisintegrated and her crew perished during re-entry, 16 minutes before scheduled landing.
Clark also recorded inside the cockpit duringColumbia's descent into the Earth's atmosphere on a small digital camera.[8]
Clark's final message to her friends and family was through an email sent fromColumbia.[9][10]In the released text of the email, Clark called the planet magnificent, and explained that while she spends much of the time working back in Spacehab and away from the sights of Earth, "whenever I do get to look out, it is glorious." Clark found that taking photos of the Earth was challenging, "Keeping my fingers crossed that they're in sharp focus." Clark also shared some of the intriguing effects of micro gravity on human physiology, such as constant challenge to stay adequately hydrated due to an "almost non-existent" sense of thirst.[11]
