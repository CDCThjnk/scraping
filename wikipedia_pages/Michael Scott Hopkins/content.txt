After graduating with his bachelor's degree, he was commissioned asecond lieutenantin January 1992.

In 1996, he attended theU.S. Air Force Test Pilot Schoolas aflight test engineer. He graduated in class 96B as a Distinguished graduate and top flight test engineer. Following Test Pilot School he was assigned to the418th Flight Test Squadrontesting theC-17andC-130aircraft. In 1999, he was sent to Canada on an exchange program. While there he lived inCold Lake, Albertaworking with the Canadian Flight Test Center.

After six months of language training, he was sent toParma, Italystudyingpolitical scienceat theUniversità degli Studi di Parma.

Following this assignment, in 2008 he was assigned as a Special Assistant to theVice Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, GeneralJames Cartwright. He was working with the Joint Chiefs when he was assigned to be an astronaut candidate.[9]

In 2009, Hopkins was one of nine astronauts selected by NASA as part ofNASA Astronaut Group 20. He began training alongside his Group mates and five international mission specialists later that year at theJohnson Space Center. He completed his training in November 2011 after two years of scientific and technical briefings, intensive instruction in International Space Station systems, spacewalks, robotics, physiological training,T-38flight training, and water and wilderness survival training.[10]
Following the completion of his astronaut training, Hopkins became available to work other jobs in the NASA Astronaut Office, as well as being eligible for a future flight assignment.[citation needed]

Expedition 37/38
In February 2011, Hopkins was assigned to the crew of ISSExpedition 37/38, becoming the first member of his astronaut class to be given a flight assignment. He began training alongside Russian cosmonautsOleg KotovandSergey Ryazanskyfor a long-duration flight to the Space Station.[11]
On September 25, 2013, Hopkins, Kotov, and Ryazansky launched on board theSoyuz TMA-10Mspacecraft. The trio docked with theInternational Space Stationseveral hours later, joining the Expedition 37 crew, which includedRoscosmoscosmonautFyodor Yurchikhin, NASA astronautKaren Nyberg, andESAastronautLuca Parmitano.[12]Shortly before their arrival aboard the station, the existing crew had welcomed theOrbital Sciences CorporationOrb-D1mission, the first demonstration flight of Orbital'sCygnusunmanned resupply spacecraft, flying under theCommercial Resupply Servicescontract.[13]
Following the departure ofSoyuz TMA-09M, carrying Yurchikin, Nyberg, and Parmitano, Hopkins and his two crewmates joined the Expedition 38 crew, with Kotov taking over as Station commander. Just prior to the departure of Soyuz TMA-09M, they had been joined by the remaining three Expedition 38 crew members: Roscosmos cosmonautMikhail Tyurin; NASA astronautRick Mastracchio; andJAXAastronautKoichi Wakata, who had arrived aboardSoyuz TMA-11M. This unusual "direct handover" was in order to allow the crew of Soyuz TMA-11M to bring up anOlympic torch, to be returned by the crew of Soyuz TMA-09M days later as part of theOlympic Torch Relayfor the2014 Winter OlympicsinSochi, Russia.[14]
During Expedition 38, Hopkins participated in two spacewalks, alongside Mastracchio, lasting 5 hours and 28 minutes and 7 hours and 30 minutes, respectively. During the spacewalks, Mastracchio and Hopkins performed maintenance and upgrades on the exterior of the station. Also during ISS-38, Hopkins was aboard the station for the berthing and release ofCygnus CRS Orb-1, the first operational flight of the Cygnus spacecraft.[15]
Hopkins and his two crewmates departed the station aboard Soyuz TMA-10M on March 10, 2014, leaving Tyrin, Masstrachio, and Wakata aboard the station as the initial crew ofExpedition 39. The trio landed inKazakhstanless than five hours later, ending a 166-day spaceflight.[16]

Expedition 64/65
In August 2018, Hopkins andVictor Gloverwere assigned to fly onSpaceX Crew-1, the first operational mission to theInternational Space Stationof the SpaceXCrew Dragonas part of NASA'sCommercial Crew Program.[17]The two were later joined by NASA astronautShannon Walkerand JAXA astronautSoichi Noguchiin March 2020.[18]
On November 15, 2020, Hopkins, Glover, Walker, and Noguchi launched onCrew DragonResilience, arriving at the Station two days later, on November 17.[5]
On December 18, 2020, Hopkins became the first astronaut to transfer from the Air Force to the Space Force in a ceremony on the International Space Station.[5][1]
On January 27, 2021, Hopkins' third spacewalk was a team effort with Victor Glover, lasting for nearly seven hours as they worked to upgrade theColumbusmodule. It was Glover's first spacewalk ever.[19]
On February 1, 2021, on the second spacewalk of the mission, and his fourth spacewalk overall, also with Glover, Hopkins replaced a broken external camera, upgraded two other cameras, and concluded a four-year campaign initiated byShane KimbroughandPeggy WhitsononExpedition 50to replace the station's batteries.[20]
Crew-1 splashed down in theGulf of Mexicoon May 2, 2021 after 167 days in space.[21]

Retirement
In June 2023, NASA announced that Hopkins had retired.[22]In September 2024, Hopkins appeared as a commentator duringSpaceX's live coverage of thePolaris Dawnspacewalk.

Personal life
Hopkins is married to Julie Hopkins (née Stutz)[10]and has two sons.[23]In 2013, Hopkins, formerly a communicant in the Methodist Church, was received into theCatholic Church, joining his wife and his children who are Catholics.
