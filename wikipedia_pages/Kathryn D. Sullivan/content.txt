Kathryn Dwyer Sullivan(born October 3, 1951) is an Americangeologist,oceanographer, and formerNASA astronautandUS Navyofficer. She was a crew member on threeSpace Shuttlemissions.
A graduate ofUniversity of California, Santa Cruz, in the United States, andDalhousie UniversityinNova Scotia, Canada—where she earned aDoctor of Philosophydegree in geology in 1978—Sullivan was selected as one of the six women among the 35astronaut candidateinNASA Astronaut Group 8, the first group to include women. During her training, she became the first woman to be certified to wear aUnited States Air Forcepressure suit, and on July 1, 1979, she set an unofficial sustained American aviation altitude record for women. During her first mission,STS-41-G, Sullivan performed the firstextra-vehicular activity(EVA) by an American woman. On her second,STS-31, she helped deploy theHubble Space Telescope. On the third,STS-45, she served asPayload Commanderon the firstSpacelabmission dedicated to NASA'sMission to Planet Earth.
Sullivan wasUnder Secretary of Commerce for Oceans and Atmosphereand Administrator of theNational Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration(NOAA) after being confirmed by theUS Senateon March 6, 2014. Her tenure ended on January 20, 2017, after which she was designated as the 2017 Charles A. Lindbergh Chair of Aerospace History at theSmithsonian Institution'sNational Air and Space Museum, and also served as a Senior Fellow at thePotomac Institute for Policy Studies. On June 7, 2020, Sullivan became the first woman to dive into theChallenger Deepin theMariana Trench, the deepest part of Earth's oceans. In September 2021, PresidentJoe Bidenappointed her to thePresident's Council of Advisors on Science and Technology.

Early life and education
Kathryn Dwyer Sullivan was born inPaterson, New Jersey, on October 3, 1951, the daughter of Donald Paul Sullivan and his wife Barbara,néeKelly.[1][2]She had a brother, Grant.[3]In 1958 the family moved to theSan Fernando Valleyin California, where her father worked in the aerospace industry forMarquardt Corporation.[4]She was in the first grade at Havenhurst Elementary School, whereSally Ridewas a classmate, but the school closed in 1958 to make way forVan Nuys Airport, and neither woman could recall meeting the other.[5]During her school years she was agirl scout.[4][6]
Sullivan graduated fromWilliam Howard Taft High Schoolin theWoodland Hillsdistrict ofLos Angeles, California, in 1969.[1]She took both French and German in high school, and resolved to have a career in the foreign service. She chose to enter theUniversity of California, Santa Cruz(UCSC), on account of its renowned Russian studies program. The university required that humanities students take three science classes and vice versa.[7]She chose to take courses inmarine biology,topologyandoceanography. She enjoyed these, and altered her course to take in more science subjects. She was an exchange student at theUniversity of Bergenin Norway for the 1971–1972 school year and the two summers around it, and decided to change her major to oceanography.[4]She was awarded aBachelor of Sciencedegree inEarth Sciencesfrom UCSC in 1973, and aDoctor of PhilosophyingeologyfromDalhousie Universityand theBedford Institute of OceanographyinNova Scotia, Canada, in 1978,[1][7]writing her doctoral thesis onThe structure and evolution of the Newfoundland Basinunder the supervision ofMichael John Keen.[8]While at Dalhousie, she participated in several oceanographic expeditions that studied the floors of the Atlantic and Pacific oceans.[9]

NASA career

Selection and training
When Sullivan visited her family for Christmas in 1976, her brother Grant, an aerospace engineer and corporate jet pilot, told her that theNational Aeronautics and Space Administration(NASA) had issued a call for applications for a new group of astronauts. NASA had made it known that it was interested in recruiting women, and Grant encouraged her to apply. He had applied for both pilot andmission specialistpositions. After she returned to Nova Scotia she saw a NASA ad in a science journal, and decided to apply. She reasoned that theSpace Shuttlewas a kind of research vessel, but her dream was still to descend to the ocean floor in asubmersible. That prospect came closer when she received an offer from William B. F. Ryan from theLamont–Doherty Earth ObservatoryatColumbia Universityto join his team exploring the ocean in the submersibleDSVAlvin. Ryan had been an unsuccessful finalist forNASA Astronaut Group 6in 1967, and he counseled her to wait for NASA to call. They both felt that the odds on being accepted were long, but Sullivan did not join Ryan's team while she waited to hear about her selection.[10]
Grant's application was unsuccessful, but Kathryn was invited to come to theJohnson Space Center(JSC) for a week of interviews and physical examinations commencing on November 14, 1977. She was the only woman in this group of twenty-five finalists.[11]Over the course of a week she was given physical and psychological examinations, and was interviewed by a selection panel chaired byGeorge Abbey. She was successful, and her selection as one of the six women among the 35 members ofNASA Astronaut Group 8was publicly announced on January 16, 1978.[12]It was the first astronaut group to include women. Sullivan was one of the three members of the group (the others being Sally Ride andSteve Hawley) for whom NASA astronaut would be their first full-time paid job since leaving university.[13]
On August 31, 1979, NASA announced that the 35astronaut candidateshad completed their training and evaluation, and were now officially astronauts, qualified for selection on space flight crews.[14]To mark the occasion theChief of the Astronaut Office,John Young, presented each of them with a silver NASAastronaut pin; they would become eligible for a gold one after they had flown in space.[15]Like other astronaut groups before them, each was given a particular assignment.[16]Sullivan helped develop systems management checklists for the first Space Shuttle flights. To give the newcomers more experience, they were periodically rotated to different jobs, so after nine months she became a mission manager at NASA's High Altitude Research Project, based at nearbyEllington Air Force Base. She became the first woman to be certified to wear aUnited States Air Forcepressure suit,[15]and on July 1, 1979, she set an unofficial sustained American aviation altitude record for women of 19,000 metres (63,000 ft) during a four-hour flight in a NASAWB-57Freconnaissance aircraft.[17]
For the first Space Shuttle mission,STS-1, Sullivan was assigned to media support, working withVic Ratnerand Bob Walker onABC News Radio. For theSTS-2mission she flew in the back seat of a NASANorthrop T-38 Talonchase plane piloted by fellow astronautHoot Gibson, photographing theSpace Shuttle tilesto verify that none had been damaged. She was then assigned to the support crew at theKennedy Space Center(KSC), along with fellow astronauts Steve Hawley,Loren ShriverandDon Williams, for the next four Space Shuttle missions.[18]

STS-41-G
In July 1983 Sullivan joined the Mission Development group, which organised and supervised the development of payloads for future missions that did not yet have a crew assigned to them. She was assigned the Office of Space and Terrestrial Applications' OSTA-3 satellite and the Orbital Refueling System (ORS). The objective of the latter was to demonstrate that the Space Shuttle could be used to refuel a satellite inorbit, thereby extending its useful life. For this the agingLandsat 4satellite was chosen. In September 1983 she was officially assigned to this mission, which was designatedSTS-41-G.[19]
Sally Ride was also assigned to this mission, so it became the first time that two women were in space together. The mission lifted off from the KSC in theSpace ShuttleChallengeron October 5, 1984.[20]Sullivan performed the firstextra-vehicular activity(EVA) by an American woman on October 11, 1984. With fellow mission specialistDavid Leestma, she performed a 3.5-hour spacewalk in which they operated the ORS to show that asatellitecould be refueled in orbit.[20]They installed a valve into a satellite propulsion system that mimicked that of Landsat4 and transferred 59 kilograms (130 lb) ofhydrazineto it using the ORS. This demonstrated that the procedure could be performed with a real satellite.[21]
During the eight-day mission, the crew also deployed the Earth Radiation Budget Satellite, conducted scientific observations of Earth with the OSTA-3 pallet (including the SIR-B radar, FILE, and MAPS experiments) and large format camera (LFC), and conducted several in-cabin experiments as well as activating eight "Getaway Special" canisters.STS-41Gcompleted 132 orbits of Earth in 197.5 hours, before landing back at the KSC on October 13, 1984.[20]

STS-61-J
In September 1985 Sullivan was assigned to theSTS-61-Jmission, which was scheduled to deploy theHubble Space Telescope(HST) in August 1986.[22]The original intention was that the HST would be periodically retrieved by the Space Shuttle and returned to Earth for maintenance, although some components were designed for servicing in-orbit. In 1984 NASA management decided this would be too dangerous and too costly, and that the HST would instead be maintained in-orbit by periodic servicing missions for up to fifteen years.[23]Convinced that NASA would attempt to fix any component that jeopardized the HST's mission whether it had been designated as serviceable or not, Sullivan pressed for as many components as possible to be replaceable or amenable to in-orbit servicing. Working with fellow astronautBruce McCandless IIand NASA andLockheed Corporationengineers, she ensured that there would be a complete set of tools and procedures for as many HST maintenance missions as possible.[24]
The STS-61-J mission was cancelled after the January 1986Space ShuttleChallengerdisaster, but the crew continued to work on the mission objectives. At this point, just fourteen systems were designated as "on-orbit maintainable". There were up to twelve units in each one, so forty-three were designated as Block I "on-orbit replaceable units" (ORUs). Lockheed produced two lists of additional units that could be modified to be serviceable; there were twenty-six systems and fifty-one units in BlockII and eight systems and sixteen units in BlockIII. With more time available, an attempt was now made to work through these.[25]Meanwhile, Sullivan served ascapsule communicator(CAPCOM) forSTS-26, the Space Shuttle's October 1988 return-to-flight mission.[26]She chose the wakeup music, including a contribution fromRobin Williams, who provided a pastiche of hisGood Morning, Vietnamradio greeting. She continued working as CAPCOM on theSTS-27andSTS-29missions.[27]

STS-31
At the end of March 1989, Sullivan returned to working on the HST mission, which was now designatedSTS-31. The crew was the same, except that Loren Shriver replaced Young as mission commander.[28]STS-31 was launched from KSC, on April 24, 1990. During this five-day mission, crew members aboard theSpace ShuttleDiscoverydeployed the HST, and conducted middeck experiments involving the study ofproteincrystal growth, polymer membrane processing, and the effects of weightlessness and magnetic fields on an ion arc. They also operated several cameras, including the IMAX cargo bay camera, for Earth observations. Theirapogeeof 617 kilometers (333 nmi) above Earth was the highest yet achieved by a Space Shuttle orbiter. (It was later exceeded by theSTS-82HST servicing mission.)[29][30]
The HST was deployed on the second day usingDiscovery'sCanadarmwith the Shuttle doors opened towards the ground. In case McCandless and Sullivan had to perform an EVA, the Shuttle's cabin pressure was lowered from 101 kilopascals (14.7 psi) to 28 kilopascals (4.1 psi).[31]At one point McCandless and Sullivan donned their space suits and entered the airlock to perform an emergency EVA to help deploy the Hubble's solar arrays, but this was not required, as the engineers were able to deploy them with a series of commands from Earth.[32]Discoveryfollowed the HST for the next two days in case intervention was required.[33]After making 76 orbits of Earth in 121 hours,Discoverylanded atEdwards Air Force BaseinCalifornia, on April 29, 1990.[29]

STS-45
Sullivan served asPayload CommanderonSTS-45, the firstSpacelabmission dedicated to NASA'sMission to Planet Earth. It lifted off in theAtlantison March 24, 1992. During this nine-day mission, the crew operated the twelve experiments that constituted the Atmospheric Laboratory for Applications and Science cargo.[34]This was the first of several flights designed to study the composition of the mid-atmosphere and its variations over an eleven-yearsolar cycle, the regular period of energetic activity by the Sun. The mission also included the Shuttle Solar Backscatter Ultraviolet Instrument (SSBUV) to measure theozone layerin concert with other measurements taken by satellites.[35]The mission also carried theOscar statuettefor theIrving G. Thalberg Memorial Awardthat film makerGeorge Lucasreceived on March 30, the presentation being made by the STS-45 crew from Earth orbit.[36]Sullivan had special responsibility for a dose-response experiment that involved firing anelectronpulse into the upper atmosphere and recording the luminosity induced with a special camera.[37]Atlantislanded at the Kennedy Space Center on April 2, 1992.[34]
Sullivan left NASA in 1993 having flown on three Space Shuttle missions and logged 532 hours in space.[1][38]

Military career
Sullivan became an adjunct professor of geology atRice Universityin Houston in 1985.[39]In this role she joined an oceanographic research cruise in 1988, where she metAndreas Rechnitzer, aUS Navyoceanographer, and she started thinking about joining theUS Naval Reserve(USNR) as an oceanography officer. She spoke to McCandless about it; he said he was having lunch with theSecretary of the Navyand would raise the matter. Later that year, Sullivan became adirect commission officerin the USNR with the rank oflieutenant commander.[26]
In October 1990 she assumed command of a small specialized unit of oceanographers and meteorologists. Based atNaval Air Station Dallas, it provided support to theNaval Meteorology and Oceanography Commandcenter onGuam. The unit was sent to Guam on January 13, 1991, four days before the start ofOperation Desert Storm, and stayed for thirty days to augment the regular component responsible for the Western Pacific to free it to concentrate on thePersian Gulf.[40]She retired from the USNR with the rank ofcaptainin 2006.[41]

Civilian career

NOAA Chief Scientist
While she was still working on preparations for STS-45, Sullivan received a call fromSylvia Earle, the chief scientist of the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA).[42]In 1981 Earle and Sullivan had been part of the first group of women admitted tothe Explorers Club.[43]Earle was stepping down from the role at the NOAA, and asked Sullivan if she was interested in taking over. With the permission of her STS-45 mission commander,Charles Bolden, Sullivan flew toWashington, DC, where she was interviewed by the Administrator of the NOAA,John A. Knauss.[42]Her nomination was forwarded to theUS Senatefor confirmation, and she arranged to be seconded from NASA to NOAA as acting chief scientist from August 17, 1992.[44]
Before she could be confirmed, PresidentGeorge H. W. Bushlost the1992 United States presidential electionand was succeeded byBill Clinton, and the nomination was withdrawn. Sullivan still wanted the job, so she lobbied for it, enlisting the help of the outgoingSecretary of Commerce,Barbara Franklin, and senatorsBarbara MikulskiandBill Nelson. The incoming Secretary of Commerce,Ronald H. Brown, forwarded her nomination to the Senate again in April, and she was confirmed on May 28, 1993.[45]As chief scientist at NOAA, she oversaw a diverse portfolio which included ranging research intoclimate change, the use of satellites for oceanography, andmarine biodiversity.[1]

Career 1996 to 2011
Sullivan was president and CEO of theCOSI Columbus, an interactive science center inColumbus, Ohio, from 1996 to 2006.[1]From 2006 to 2011 she was Director forOhio State University'sBattelleCenter for Mathematics and Science Education Policy while remaining a volunteer science advisor to COSI.[1]She was appointed as vice chair of theNational Science Boardby PresidentGeorge W. Bushin 2004.[46]In 2009 Sullivan was elected to a three-year term as the chair of the Section on General Interest in Science and Engineering for theAmerican Association for the Advancement of Science.[47]

Assistant Secretary of Commerce
In January 2011 PresidentBarack Obamasent the Senate his nomination of Sullivan to be an Assistant Secretary of Commerce. Sullivan was first nominated in December 2010, but because the Senate did not approve her nomination before the session ended, the White House renewed the nomination. On May 4, 2011, Sullivan was confirmed by unanimous consent of the Senate and appointed by President Obama to serve as Assistant Secretary of Commerce for Environmental Observation and Prediction and Deputy Administrator for the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration.[48]Sullivan became Acting Under Secretary of Commerce for Oceans and Atmosphere and Acting NOAA Administrator on February 28, 2013, following the resignation ofJane Lubchenco.[49]President Obama nominated Sullivan to serve as the Under Secretary of Commerce for Oceans and Atmosphere and NOAA Administrator on August 1, 2013, and she was confirmed by the Senate on March 6, 2014.[50][49]Her term ended on January 20, 2017.[51]

Positions since 2017
Sullivan was named the 2017 Charles A. Lindbergh Chair of Aerospace History, a competitive twelve-month fellowship at theNational Air and Space Museum. During her residence in the museum, Sullivan's research focused on the Hubble Space Telescope.[52]She has also served as a Senior Fellow at thePotomac Institute for Policy Studies.[53]Her bookHandprints on Hubble: An Astronaut's Story of Inventionwas released from MIT Press in November 2019. It recounted her experience as part of the team that launched, rescued, repaired, and maintained the Hubble Space Telescope.[54][55]
In June 2020 Sullivan traveled on an expedition aboard theTriton SubmarinesDSVLimiting Factorto the bottom of theChallenger Deepin theMariana Trench, becoming the first woman and eighthperson to reach the deepest known pointin Earth's oceans,[56][57][58]and the first person to travel both to Challenger Deep and into space.[59]In November 2020 Sullivan was named a volunteer member ofJoe Biden'spresidential transitionAgency Review Team to support transition efforts related to theDepartment of Commerce,[60]and he appointed her to thePresident's Council of Advisors on Science and Technologyin September 2021.[61]

Awards and recognition
Sullivan's awards from NASA included theNASA Space Flight Medalin 1984, 1990 and 1992; theNASA Exceptional Service Medalin 1988 and 1991, theNASA Outstanding Leadership Medalin 1992, and a Certificate of Appreciation in 1996.[62]She received the Haley Space Flight Award in 1991,[63]the Gold Medal of theSociety of Woman Geographersin 1993,[64][65]the Golden Plate Award of theAmerican Academy of Achievementin 1994,[66]and theAdler PlanetariumWomen in Space Science Award in 2004.[67]
In 2014 Sullivan was named in theTime100list, an annual list of the world's most influential people.John Glennwrote in her blurb:
Kathy is not just an ivory-tower scientist. She was part of NASA's first class of female astronauts, selected in 1978, and went on to fly three shuttle missions. She is the first American woman to walk in space and served aboard the mission that deployed the Hubble Space Telescope. That role in helping humanity look outward has not prevented her from looking homeward. The planet is suffering increasingly severe upheavals, at least partly a result of climate change—droughts,floods,typhoons,tornadoes. I believe my good friend Kathy is the right person for the right job at the right time.[68]
Sullivan received honoraryDoctor of Sciencedegrees fromWillamette Universityin 2013 in conjunction with her presentation of a commencement address,[69]and fromBrown Universityin May 2015, for her "abundant contributions to science, education and the public good, and her ongoing commitment to improving the state of our planet for future generations".[47][70]In September 2015 she presented the John H. Glenn Lecture in Space History Series at the Smithsonian National Air and Space Museum in Washington, D.C. Titled "Looking at Earth: An Astronaut's Journey", Sullivan discussed her life of exploration and discovery, what it is like to fulfill her childhood dreams, and how NOAA's study of our planet helps us understand today's environmental challenges.[71]
Sullivan was inducted into theAstronaut Hall of Famein 2004,[72]elected to theNational Academy of Engineeringin 2016,[73]and theAmerican Academy of Arts and Sciencesin 2017.[74]In 2020 the American Association of Geographers named her Honorary Geographer.[75]She was on the list of theBBC's100 Womenannounced on November 23, 2020.[76]In September 2023, Sullivan was inducted into theNational Aviation Hall of Famein Dayton, Ohio.[77]
