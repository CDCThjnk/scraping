NASA career
In April 1990, Johnson was accepted as an aerospace engineer and research pilot at the NASA JSC Aircraft Operations Division,Ellington Field, Texas. He qualified as aT-38 Taloninstructor pilot, functional check flight and examiner pilot, as well asGulfstream Iaircraft commander,WB-57F Canberrahigh altitude research pilot andKC-135co-pilot. Additionally, he conducted flight test programs in the T-38 aircraft including JET-A airstart testing, T-38N avionics upgrade testing and the first flight of the T-38 inlet redesign aircraft. In 1994 he assumed duties as the Chief, Maintenance & Engineering Branch responsible for all maintenance and engineering modifications on NASA JSC's 44 aircraft.
Selected by NASA as an astronaut candidate in June 1998, he reported for training in August 1998. Johnson was the class leader for the seventeenth group of astronauts, with 31 U.S. and international members. Johnson was initially assigned as an Astronaut Support Personnel (ASP) responsible for configuring the Orbiter switches prior to launch and strapping astronauts in their seats for launch. More recently he served as theAstronaut Officerepresentative for all technical aspects of orbiter landing and roll out issues. From June 2004 to November 2005, Johnson served as Manager, Launch Integration, for theSpace Shuttle programatKennedy Space Center, Florida.[1]He also served as the Astronaut Office Deputy, Shuttle Branch and Return to Flight Representative.
Johnson graduated with fellow astronautGregory H. Johnson, in the1998 NASA Group 17. Gregory H. served as ascent/reentryCAPCOMon mission STS-125, while Gregory C. piloted STS-125 onAtlantis. They are not related and can be distinguished by theircall signs. Gregory H. Johnson is known as "Box", while Gregory C. Johnson is known as "Ray J".[1]

Spaceflight experience
Johnson was the pilot onSTS-125, the final Space Shuttle mission to theHubble Space Telescope. It lasted from May 11–24, 2009, traveling 5,276,000 miles in 197Earth orbits.Atlantiscarried two new instruments to the telescope, the Cosmic Origins Spectrograph and the Wide Field Camera 3. The mission also replaced a Fine Guidance Sensor, six gyroscopes, and two battery unit modules to allow the telescope to continue to function at least through 2014. The crew also installed new thermal blanket insulating panels to provide improved thermal protection, and a soft-capture mechanism that would aid in the safe de-orbiting of the telescope by an unmanned spacecraft at the end of its operational lifespan. The mission also carried an IMAX camera and the crew documented the progress of the mission for the movieHubble.[2]
