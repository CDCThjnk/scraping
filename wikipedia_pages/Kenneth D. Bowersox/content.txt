This module housed experiments related to fluid dynamics, crystal growth, combustion, and biological processes.[7]: 23–26
The mission concluded with a landing at theShuttle Landing Facility, Florida on July 9, 1992, at 11:42:27 UTC.[7]: 5

STS-61
Bowersox's second mission was STS-61 aboard theEndeavour, in which he served as the pilot.[8]The mission was launched on December 2, 1993, fromLaunch Complex 39Bat 09:27:00 UTC.[9]: 2The mission's primary objective was the first servicing of theHubble Space Telescope, during which astronauts performed a series of spacewalks to repair and upgrade the telescope's systems, thereby restoring its optical performance and extending its operational lifespan.[9]: 1STS-61 concluded with theEndeavourlanding successfully at the Shuttle Landing Facility on December 13, 1993, at 05:25:37 UTC.[9]: 4

STS-73
Bowersox's third mission was STS-73 aboard theColumbia, where he served for the first time as the mission commander.[10]The mission was launched on October 20, 1995, fromLaunch Complex 39Bat 13:53:00 UTC.[11]: 3STS-73's primary objective was to conduct a series of experiments in the U.S. Microgravity Laboratory-2 (USML-2), focusing on materials science, biotechnology,combustion science, and fluid mechanics in the unique microgravity environment of space.[11]The mission concluded withColumbialanding successfully at the Shuttle Landing Facility on November 5, 1995, at 11:45:21 UTC.[11]: 8

STS-82
Bowersox's fourth mission in space was STS-82 aboard theDiscovery, where he served as the mission commander.

The tasks undertaken aimed to enhance the telescope's operational capabilities. Following the completion of its objectives, STS-82 concluded withDiscoverylanding at the Shuttle Landing Facility on February 21, 1997, at 08:32:00 UTC.[13]

ISS Expedition 6
Bowersox served as the commander of Expedition 6 to the International Space Station (ISS). Alongside him were crewmatesNikolai BudarinandDonald Pettit.[14]As commander, Bowersox was responsible for the overall success of the mission and the safety of his crew.[15]

They landed near Arkalyk, Kazakhstan, on May 4, 2003, at 02:04 UTC.[17]
