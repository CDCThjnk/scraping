David Carl Hilmers(born January 28, 1950) is a formerNASAastronautwho flew fourSpace Shuttlemissions. He was born inClinton, Iowa, but considersDeWitt, Iowa, to be his hometown. He has two grown sons. His recreational interests include playing the piano, gardening, electronics, spending time with his family, and all types of sports. His parents are deceased. With five academic degrees, he is the second most formally educated U.S. astronaut, behindStory MusgraveandLee Morinwith six.

Education
Graduated from Central Community High School inDeWitt, Iowa, in 1968; received aBachelor of Artsdegree inmathematics(summa cum laude) fromCornell Collegein 1972, aMaster of Sciencedegree inelectrical engineering(with distinction) in 1977, and the degree of Electrical Engineer from the U.S.Naval Postgraduate Schoolin 1978.  He received aDoctor of Medicine(M.D.) degree from theBaylor College of Medicinein 1995 with honors and aMaster of Sciencedegree inPublic Health(MPH) from theUTHealth School of Public HealthatUniversity of Texas Health Science Center at Houston(UTHealth) in 2002.

Experience
Hilmers entered active duty with theUnited States Marine Corpsin July 1972. On completingThe Basic SchoolandNaval Flight OfficerSchool, he was assigned toVMA(AW)-121atMarine Corps Air Station Cherry Point,North Carolina, flying theA-6 Intruderas a bombardier-navigator. In 1975, he became an air liaison officer with the1st Battalion, 2nd Marines, stationed with theSixth Fleetin theMediterranean. He graduated from the U.S.Naval Postgraduate Schoolin 1978 and was later assigned to the1st Marine Aircraft WingatMarine Corps Air Station Iwakuni, Japan. He was stationed with the3rd Marine Aircraft WingatMarine Corps Air Station El Toro,California, at the time of his selection by NASA.

NASA experience
Hilmers was selected a NASA astronaut in July 1980 and completed the initial training period in August 1981. In 1983 he was selected as a member of the launch-ready standby crew. His early NASA assignments have included work on rocket upper stages such asPAM,IUS, andCentaur, as well as Shuttle software verification at theShuttle Avionics Integration Laboratory(SAIL). In addition, he was the Astronaut Office training coordinator, worked on various Department of Defense payloads, served as a spacecraft communicator (CAPCOM) at Mission Control forSTS-41-D,STS-41-G,STS-51-A,STS-51-CandSTS-51-D, worked Space Station issues for the Astronaut Office, and served as head of the Mission Development Branch within the Astronaut Office. In May 1985 he was named to the crew ofSTS-61-F, which was to deploy theUlyssesspacecraft on an interplanetary trajectory using a Centaur upper stage. This mission was to have flown in May 1986, but the Shuttle Centaur project was terminated in July 1986, and Hilmers then worked in the areas of ascent abort development, payload safety, and Shuttle on-board software. During 1987 he was involved in training for STS-26 and in flight software development.  He later became head of the Mission Development branch in the astronaut office.
A veteran of four space flights, he has logged over 493 hours in space. He served as a mission specialist on STS-51-J (October 3–7, 1985), STS-26 (September 29 to October 3, 1988), STS-36 (February 28 to March 4, 1990), and STS-42 (January 22–30, 1992).

Space flight experience
STS-51-JAtlantis, a classifiedDepartment of Defensemission, launched fromKennedy Space Center,Florida, on October 3, 1985. This was the maiden voyage of the OrbiterAtlantis. Hilmers had prime responsibility for a number of on-orbit activities during the mission. After 98 hours of orbital operations,Atlantislanded atEdwards Air Force Base, California, on October 7, 1985.
STS-26Discovery, the first mission to be flown after theChallengeraccident, was launched from the Kennedy Space Center, Florida, on September 29, 1988. During the four-day mission, the crew successfully deployed theTracking and Data Relay Satellite(TDRS-C), which was subsequently carried to orbit by the Inertial Upper Stage (IUS) rocket. They also operated eleven mid-deck experiments.Discoverycompleted 64 orbits of the Earth before landing at Edwards Air Force Base, California, on October 3, 1988.
STS-36Atlantislaunched from the Kennedy Space Center, Florida, on February 28, 1990. This mission carried Department of Defense payloads and a number of secondary payloads. After 72 orbits of the Earth, the STS-36 mission concluded with a lakebed landing at Edwards Air Force Base, California, on March 4, 1990, after traveling 1.87 million miles.
Hilmers replacedManley Lanier "Sonny" Carter Jr., killed in a plane crash, for his last mission.[1]STS-42Discoverylaunched from the Kennedy Space Center, Florida, on January 22, 1992. Fifty-five major experiments conducted in the International Microgravity Laboratory-1 module were provided by investigators from eleven countries, and represented a broad spectrum of scientific disciplines. During 128 orbits of the Earth, the STS-42 crew accomplished the mission's primary objective of investigating the effects of microgravity on materials processing and life sciences. In this unique laboratory in space, crew members worked around-the-clock in two shifts. Experiments investigated the microgravity effects on the growth of protein and semiconductor crystals. Biological experiments on the effects of zero gravity on plants, tissues, bacteria, insects and human vestibular response were also conducted. This eight-day mission culminated in a landing at Edwards Air Force Base, California, on January 30, 1992.

Post-NASA experience
Hilmers decided to apply to medical school while training for his third shuttle flight. He attendedpre-medcourses at night while training for his fourth flight.[1]Hilmers retired from NASA and the United States Marine Corps in October 1992, and went on to complete medical school and residency in the combined Internal Medicine/Pediatrics program at Baylor College of Medicine.  He currently holds the rank of Professor in the departments of Internal Medicine and Pediatrics, the Center for Space Medicine, and Baylor Global Initiatives at theBaylor College of MedicineinHouston, Texas.  In addition to his teaching and clinical duties, he is involved in research in global health and malnutrition in many countries.  He spends much of his spare time providing humanitarian medical care locally in Houston and in developing nations, including disaster relief efforts in Iraq, Peru, Sri Lanka, the Philippines, Haiti, in Liberia during the Ebola outbreak in 2014, and development of hepatitis B clinical and public health services in Madagascar, North Korea and Kiribati through affiliation withHepatitis B Free.
