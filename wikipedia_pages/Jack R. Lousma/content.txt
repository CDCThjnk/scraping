Lousma was inducted into theUnited States Astronaut Hall of Famein 1997. He is the last living crew member of both of his spaceflights.
Lousma later was theRepublican Partynominee for a seat in theUnited States SenatefromMichiganin1984, losing to incumbentCarl Levin, who won his second of six terms.

Early life and education
Lousma was born inGrand Rapids, Michigan, on February 29, 1936.[1]He is of Dutch (Frisian) descent.[2]His father's name was spelled Louwsma, but he kept the 'w' off of his son's birth certificate to make the name easier to spell.[3]He graduated from Angell Elementary School,Tappan Middle School, andPioneer High SchoolinAnn Arbor, Michiganin 1954.[4]Lousma was aBoy Scoutand earned the rank ofTenderfoot Scout.[5]
Lousma received aBachelor of Sciencedegree inaeronautical engineeringfrom theUniversity of Michiganin 1959.[6]He played on thefootball teamas a backupquarterbackuntil an elbow injury ended his career.[2]He earned aMaster of Sciencedegree in aeronautical engineering from the U.S.Naval Postgraduate Schoolin 1965.[7]

Military service
Lousma became aUnited States Marine Corpsofficer in 1959, and he received hisaviator wingsin 1960 after completing training at theNaval Air Training Command. He was then assigned toVMA-224,2nd Marine Aircraft Wing(2nd MAW), as an attack pilot, and he later served with VMA-224,1st Marine Air Wing, atMarine Corps Air Station Iwakuni,Japan. He was a reconnaissance pilot withVMCJ-2, 2nd MAW, atMarine Corps Air Station Cherry Point,North Carolina, before being assigned to theManned Spacecraft CenterinHouston,Texas.[7]
Lousma has logged 7,000 hours of flight time; including 700 hours ingeneral aviationaircraft, 1,619 hours in space, 4,500 hours injet aircraft, and 240 hours inhelicopters.[8]

NASA career
Lousma was one of the 19 astronauts selected inNASA Astronaut Group 5in April 1966.[9]He served as a member of the astronaut support crews for theApollo 9,10, and13missions.[2]He was theCAPCOMrecipient of the "Houston, we've had a problem" message fromApollo 13.[10]He was a potential candidate to serve as the lunar module pilot forApollo 20, which was cancelled due to budget cuts.[11]He was the pilot for Skylab-3 from July 28 to September 25, 1973, and was commander on STS-3, from March 22 until March 30, 1982, logging a total of over 1,619 hours in space.[12]
Lousma also spent 11 hours on twospacewalksoutside the Skylab space station. He served as backup docking module pilot of the United States flight crew for theApollo-Soyuz Test Projectmission, which was completed successfully in July 1975.[2]

Skylab 3
The crew on this 59½ day flight includedAlan Bean(spacecraft commander), Lousma (pilot), andOwen K. Garriott, who acted as a science-pilot. The crew installed six replacement rategyroscopesused forattitude controlof the spacecraft and a twin-polesunshadeused forthermal control, and they repaired nine major experiment or operational equipment items. Skylab-3 accomplished all its mission goals while completing 858 revolutions of theEarth, and traveling some 39,300,000 km (24,400,000 mi) in orbit. They devoted 305 man-hours to extensive solar observations from above the atmosphere, which included viewing two majorsolar flaresand numerous smaller flares andcoronal transients. Also acquired and returned to Earth were 16,000 photographs and 29 km (18 mi) ofmagnetic tapedocumenting Earth resources observations. The crew completed 333 medical experiment performances and obtained valuable data on the effects of extendedweightlessnesson humans. Skylab-3 ended with aPacific Oceansplashdownand recovery byUSSNew Orleans.[8]

STS-3
Lousma was originally selected as the pilot of the two-man crew ofSTS-2, alongside commanderFred Haise. This was a planned mission scheduled to launch in mid-1979, which was intended to use theTeleoperator Retrieval Systemto boost the orbit of Skylab, to allow for the space station's potential further use. This mission was eventually scrubbed, owing to the delays in getting the Shuttle system ready for flight.[13]As a result, following Haise's decision to leave NASA, Lousma was named as commander of STS-3.
STS-3, the third orbital test flight of Space ShuttleColumbia, launched from theKennedy Space Center,Florida, on March 22, 1982, into a 290 km (180 mi) circular orbit above the Earth. Lousma was the spacecraft commander andC. Gordon Fullertonwas the pilot on this eight-day mission. Major flight test objectives included exposingColumbiato extremes in thermal stress and the first use of the 15 m (49 ft)Remote Manipulator System(RMS) to grapple and maneuver aPayloadin space. The crew also operated several scientific experiments in the orbiter's cabin and on the OSS-1 pallet in the payload bay.Columbiaresponded favorably to the thermal tests and was found to be better than expected as a scientific platform. The crew accomplished almost all the mission objectives assigned, and after a one-day delay due to bad weather, landed on the lake bed atWhite Sands, New Mexico, on March 30, 1982, the only shuttle flight to land there.Columbiatraveled 5,500,000 km (3,400,000 mi) during 129.9 orbits and mission duration was 192 hours, 4 minutes, 49 seconds. Lousma left NASA on October 1, 1983, and retired from the Marine Corps on November 1, 1983.[14]

Political experience
A Republican, Lousma lost the 1984 United States Senate election in Michigan against incumbent Carl Levin, receiving 47% of the vote.[15]The astronaut-politician survived a bitter primary fight against former Republican congressmanJim Dunnto capture the nomination with 63% of the vote.Ronald Reagan's landslide re-election was a boon to Lousma, but he was hurt late in the campaign when video surfaced of him telling a group of Japanese auto manufacturers that his family owned aToyotacar.[16]

Personal life
Lousma and Gratia Kay were married in 1956. They have four children. A long-time resident of Scio Township, near Ann Arbor, Michigan, he moved with his wife toTexasin September 2013.[4]

Carraccepted the 1975Dr. Robert H. Goddard Memorial TrophyfromPresident Ford, awarded to the Skylab astronauts.[22]
Lousma was inducted with Fullerton into theInternational Space Hall of Fameduring a ceremony with the governor of New Mexico in 1982 for their involvement in the STS-3 mission.[23]The governor also presented them with the International Space Hall of Fame's Pioneer Award, and were the second group to receive this award.[24]He was inducted the Michigan Aviation Hall of Fame in 1989.[25]He was one of 24 Apollo astronauts who were inducted into theU.S. Astronaut Hall of Famein 1997.[26]
He was presented an honorary doctorate of astronautical science from theUniversity of Michiganin 1973,[27]an honoraryD.Sc.fromHope Collegein 1982,[28]an honorary D.Sc. inbusiness administrationfromCleary Collegein 1986, and an honorary doctorate fromSterling Collegein 1988.[10]
