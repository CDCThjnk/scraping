Robert Franklyn"Bob"Overmyer(July 14, 1936 – March 22, 1996) was an Americantest pilot,naval aviator,aeronautical engineer,physicist,United States Marine Corps officer, andUSAF/NASAastronaut. Overmyer was selected by the Air Force as an astronaut for itsManned Orbiting Laboratoryin 1966. Upon cancellation of the program in 1969, he became a NASA astronaut and served support crew duties for theApollo program,Skylabprogram, andApollo–Soyuz Test Project. In 1976, he was assigned to theSpace Shuttle programand flew as pilot onSTS-5in 1982 and as commander onSTS-51-Bin 1985. He was selected as a lead investigator into theSpace ShuttleChallengerdisasterin 1986, retiring from NASA that same year. A decade later, Overmyer died while testing theCirrus VK-30homebuilt aircraft.

Early life and education
Overmyer was born on July 14, 1936, to Rolandus Overmyer (1906–1968) and Margaret June Overmyer (néeFabian; 1908–1979) inLorain, Ohio, but consideredWestlake, Ohio, his hometown. Overmyer was active in theBoy Scouts of Americaand earned the rank ofFirst Class.[1]He graduated fromWestlake High Schoolin 1954 and earned aBachelor of Sciencedegree inphysicsfromBaldwin–Wallace Collegein 1958, and aMaster of Sciencedegree inaeronauticswith a major inaeronautical engineeringfrom the U.S.Naval Postgraduate Schoolin 1964.[2]

Career

Marine Corps
Overmyer entered active duty with the Marine Corps in January 1958. After completing Navy flight training inKingsville, Texas, he was assigned toVMA-214in November 1959. He was assigned to the U.S. Naval Postgraduate School in 1962 to study aeronautical engineering. Upon completion of his graduate studies, he served one year with Marine Maintenance Squadron 17 atMCAS Iwakuni, Japan before being assigned to theU.S. Air Force Test Pilot SchoolatEdwards Air Force Base,California. He was chosen as an astronaut for theManned Orbiting Laboratory(MOL) program in 1966.[2]
Overmyer logged over 7,500 flight hours, with over 6,000 injet aircraft.[2]

NASA
The MOL program was canceled in 1969 and Overmyer was selected as part ofNASA Astronaut Group 7, where his first assignment was engineering development on theSkylabProgram from 1969 to 1971. From 1971–72, he was a support crew member forApollo 17and was the launchcapsule communicator(CAPCOM). From 1973–75, he was a support crew member for theApollo–Soyuz Test Projectand was the NASA CAPCOM in the mission control center inMoscow. In 1976, he was assigned duties on the space shuttleApproach and Landing Tests(ALT) program and was the primeT-38 Talonchase pilot for Orbiter Free-Flights 1 and 3. In 1979, he was assigned as the deputy vehicle manager of OV-102 (Columbia) in charge of finishing the manufacturing and tiling ofColumbiaat the Kennedy Space Center in preparation for its first flight. This assignment lasted untilColumbiawas transported to the launch pad in 1980.[2]
Overmyer was the pilot forSTS-5, the first fully operational flight of the shuttle program, which launched fromKennedy Space Center,Florida, on November 11, 1982. He was accompanied by spacecraft commanderVance D. Brandand twomission specialists,Joseph P. AllenandWilliam B. Lenoir. STS-5, the first mission with a four-man crew, clearly demonstrated the shuttle as fully operational by the successful first deployment of two commercial communications satellites from the orbiter's payload bay. The mission marked the first use of thePayload Assist Module(PAM-D) and its new ejection system. Numerous flight tests were performed throughout the mission to document shuttle performance during launch, boost, orbit, atmospheric entry and landing phases. STS-5 was the last flight to carry the Development Flight Instrumentation (DFI) package to support flight testing. AGetaway Special, three Student Involvement Projects and medical experiments were also included on the mission. The STS-5 crew successfully concluded the five-day orbital flight ofColumbiawith the first entry and landing through a cloud deck to a hard-surface runway and demonstrated maximum braking. Mission duration was 122 hours before landing on a concrete runway at Edwards Air Force Base, California, on November 16, 1982.[2]
Overmyer was the commander ofSTS-51-B, the Spacelab-3 (SL-3) mission. He commanded a crew of four astronauts and twopayload specialistsconducting a broad range of scientific experiments from space physics to the suitability of animal holding facilities. STS-51-B was also the first shuttle flight to launch a small payload from a "Getaway Special" canister. STS-51-B launched at 12:02 p.m. EDT on April 29, 1985, from Kennedy Space Center, Florida, and landed at Edwards Air Force Base, California, at 9:11 a.m. PDT on May 6, 1985. STS-51-B completed 110 orbits of Earth at an altitude of 190 nautical miles.[2]
In 1986, Overmyer was involved in the recovery of theChallengerdisastercrew remains and was also one of NASA's lead investigators into the incident.[3][4]
Overmyer retired from NASA and the Marine Corps in May 1986.[2]

Post NASA
After retiring from the space industry, Overmyer commenced his own consulting business, Mach Twenty Five International, Inc. He consulted with major aerospace corporations and the National Broadcasting Corporation (NBC) as well as writing a column for the British magazine Space Flight News. In March 1988, he joined the Space Station Team atMcDonnell DouglasAerospace, where he led crew and operations activities for seven years. He retired from McDonnell Douglas in April 1995 and expanded the scope of Mach Twenty Five International, continuing his aerospace consultation work as well as speaking engagements and writing.
Overmyer continued his career as ageneral aviationtest pilot. Having former experience with aeronautical testing at bothU.S. Air Force Test Pilot SchoolandNASA, he joinedDuluth, Minnesota-based aircraft manufacturerCirrus Design(now called Cirrus Aircraft) as a test pilot in November 1995. He contributed tostalltesting of the company's first design, theCirrus VK-30kit aircraft, which first flew in 1988. He also performed earlycertificationtesting for theCirrus SR20, which was certified in 1998 and helped pioneer the use ofglass cockpits,composite materialsandballistic parachutesin thelightproduction aircraft industry.[5]

Death and family
Overmyer died in a plane crash on March 22, 1996, near theDuluth International Airportwhile testing the VK-30.[5]He was testing the plane's wing for full-flapstallrecovery characteristics at aftcenter of gravity limitswhen the aircraft departed controlled flight. He was interred atArlington National Cemetery[6][7]and is survived by his wife, Katherine, and three children: Carolyn Marie (born 1966), Patricia Ann (born 1968), and Robert Rolandus (born 1970).[2]

Organizations and honors
Overmyer was a member of theSociety of Experimental Test Pilots,Experimental Aircraft Association, andAircraft Owners and Pilots Association.[2]
He was awarded theAir Force Meritorious Service Medalin 1969 for duties with the USAF Manned Orbiting Laboratory program; the Marine Corps Meritorious Service Medal in 1978 for duties as the chief chase pilot and support crewman for the Shuttle Approach and Landing Test Program; anHonoraryDoctor of Philosophydegree from Baldwin–Wallace College, December 1982; the U.S. Naval Postgraduate School Distinguished Engineers Award in January 1983; theDistinguished Flying Cross(1983); and theNASA Space Flight Medal(1983).[2]
There is an OhioHistorical Markerin Clague Park,Westlake, Ohio, commemorating his life and career.[8]
