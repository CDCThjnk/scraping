Thomas Patten Stafford(September 17, 1930 – March 18, 2024) was an AmericanAir Force officer,test pilot, andNASA astronaut, and one of24 astronauts who flew to the Moon. He also served asChief of the Astronaut Officefrom 1969 to 1971.
After graduating from theUnited States Naval Academy, Stafford was commissioned in theUnited States Air Force, flying theF-86 Sabrebefore becoming a test pilot.  He was selected to become an astronaut in 1962, and flew aboardGemini 6Ain 1965 andGemini 9Ain 1966. In 1969, he commandedApollo 10, the second crewed mission to orbit theMoon. Here, he andGene Cernanbecame the first to fly anApollo Lunar Modulein lunar orbit, descending to an altitude of nine miles (fourteen kilometres).
In 1975, Stafford was the commander of theApollo-Soyuz Test Project(ASTP) flight, the first joint U.S.-Sovietspace mission. Abrigadier generalat the time, he became the first general officer to fly in space. He was the first member of his Naval Academy class to pin on the first, second, and third stars of a general officer.  He made six rendezvous in space and logged 507 hours of space flight.
Stafford flew more than 120 types of fixed-wing androtary aircraftand three types ofspacecraft. After the deaths ofWally Schirra,Eugene Cernan, andJohn Young, he was the last surviving crew member of Gemini 6A, Gemini 9A, and Apollo 10.
In 1993, theStafford Air & Space Museumwas founded in his hometown of Weatherford, Oklahoma. Originally just two rooms, it has grown to over 63,000 square feet (5,850 m2) of artifact space. It is aSmithsonianaffiliate and is the only museum in the world to house test-fired engines that would have been used in the Space Race: a U.S.F-1 engineand a SovietNK-33engine. It holds theGemini 6spacecraft that he and Schirra flew in a rendezvous withGemini 7.

Early life and education
Thomas Patten Stafford was born on September 17, 1930, inWeatherford, Oklahoma, to Dr. Thomas Sabert Stafford, a dentist, and Mary Ellen Stafford (néePatten), a former teacher. Thomas Sabert Stafford was diagnosed with skin cancer in 1944, and died on June 22, 1948. Mary Stafford remained in Weatherford until her death in August 1987. Stafford became interested in aviation following the start of World War II, as the nearby cityEl Renohas an Army Air Corps training base.  Stafford began making model airplanes, and made his first flight  at the age of 14 in aPiper Cub. He attendedWeatherford High Schooland graduated in 1948.[1]: 1–4, 219
In his senior year of high school, Stafford was recruited to play football at theUniversity of Oklahoma, where he had received aNavy ROTCscholarship. Stafford applied to theUnited States Naval Academy, and was accepted to the Class of 1952. Stafford intended to play football for theNavy Midshipmen, but sustained a career-ending knee injury during a preseason practice session. After his freshman year, he sailed aboard thebattleshipUSSMissouri, where his roommate wasJohn Young, his future Apollo 10 command module pilot. After his second year, Stafford spent a summer atNAS Pensacola, where he was exposed to naval aviation and flew in theSNJ Trainer. On a trip home to Weatherford, Stafford began dating his future wife, Faye Shoemaker. After his third year, he served aboardUSSBurdo, adestroyerescorting USSMissouri. While visiting home during his fourth year, Stafford became engaged to Faye in December 1951. In the spring of 1952, he was selected in a lottery to join theUnited States Air Forceupon graduation.[note 1]Stafford graduated from the Naval Academy with aBachelor of Sciencedegree in engineering with honors in 1952, and was commissioned as asecond lieutenantin the Air Force.[1]: 8–13[2]

Military service
In high school, Stafford served in the45th Infantry Divisionin theOklahoma National Guard. Soon after, he transferred to the division's158th Field Artillery Battalion, where he plotted targets for artillery fires.[1]: 6[3]
Stafford attended the first phase of pilot training atGreenville AFB,Mississippi,San Marcos AFB,TexasandConnally AFB, Texas, where he flew theT-6 Texanand theT-33 Shooting Star. While on a training mission at San Marcos AFB, he was involved in a mid-air collision with another student pilot. Stafford and his instructor were able to land, but the other student pilot was killed. He graduated from pilot training on September 1, 1953, and moved toTyndall AFB,Florida, forF-86 Sabretraining. In 1954, Stafford was assigned to the54th Fighter-Interceptor SquadronatEllsworth AFB,South Dakota, where he flew the F-86 mission forArcticdefense. In 1955, Stafford transferred to the496th Fighter Interceptor Squadronat Hahn Air Base (nowFrankfurt-Hahn Airport),West Germany, again flying interceptor mission in the F-86 Sabre. In addition, he served as an assistant maintenance officer, developing his interest in applying for theUSAF Experimental Flight Test Pilot School.[1]: 13–24
In 1958, Stafford attended the Air Force Test Pilot School atEdwards AFB,California, where he finished first in his class, and received the A. B. Honts Award. After graduation, he remained at Edwards AFB as aflight instructor. While working as an instructor, Stafford created the first civilian instructor position at Test Pilot School to ensure continuity, and co-wrote thePilot's Handbook for Performance Flight Testingand theAerodynamics Handbook for Performance Flight Testing.[4]At the end of his assignment, Stafford was accepted atHarvard Business School, and moved toBoston, Massachusetts, in September 1962. Three days after arriving, he was accepted toNASA Group Two.[1]: 27–38

NASA career
In April 1962, while working as a flight instructor, Stafford applied for the next round of astronaut selection.  The required interviews and medical screenings occurred over the summer of 1962 atBrooks Air Force Baseand in Houston.  On September 14, 1962, Stafford was selected forAstronaut Group 2, alongside eight other future astronauts.[1]: 35–40[5]

Project Gemini
Stafford was originally scheduled to fly withAlan Shepardon the first crewed Gemini mission,Gemini 3, but was replaced when Shepard was removed from the flight rotation after being diagnosed withMénière's disease. Stafford was paired withWally Schirraas pilot and commander, respectively, and the pair was reassigned as the backup crew for Gemini 3, and primary crew for Gemini 6.[1]: 50
The original Gemini 6 mission profile involved docking with anAgena target vehicle. On October 25, 1965, Schirra and Stafford were inside Gemini 6 before liftoff when the Agena vehicle exploded on ascent. After the original mission was canceled, it was redesignated Gemini 6A and was planned to rendezvous with the long-duration Gemini 7 mission. Gemini 7 lifted off on December 4, 1965. On December 12, 1965, Gemini 6A's ignition was followed by an immediate engine shutdown. Schirra and Stafford did not eject, and the cause of the shutdown was found to be an electrical issue and a cap inadvertently left on a fuel line.[1]: 64–72
On December 15, 1965, Gemini 6A lifted off and rendezvoused with Gemini 7. The two spacecraftkept stationfor about five hours, coming within feet of each other. Gemini 6A splashed down on December 16, and was recovered byUSSWasp.[1]: 70–76
Before Gemini 6A, Stafford was assigned as the backup commander for Gemini 9 withEugene Cernanas the backup pilot.Charlie BassettandElliot Seewere the primary crew. On February 28, 1966, both crews flew inT-38 TalonstoLambert Fieldto visit theMcDonnell DouglasGemini assembly facility. Bassett and See crashed on landing, and were killed. Stafford and Cernan became the Gemini 9 primary crew, withJim LovellandBuzz Aldrinas their backup crew.[1]: 75–82
On May 17, 1966, the Agena target vehicle went off course and was shut down before entering orbit. As there was no replacement Agena rocket, the new target for the mission was theAugmented Target Docking Adapter (ATDA), which achieved orbit on June 1, 1966. The Gemini 9A launch, scheduled for later the same day, was canceled due to a computer error. Gemini 9A launched on June 3, and rendezvoused with the ATDA on the second orbit. Its shroud had only partially opened and Gemini 9A was unable to dock with it. Stafford and Cernan instead conducted orbital rendezvous maneuvers with it, including a simulated rescue of a lunar module in a lower orbit.[1]: 85–92
The following day, Cernan attempted anextravehicular activity(EVA), with the primary mission of testing theAstronaut Maneuvering Unit(AMU). After exiting the spacecraft, Cernan quickly experienced mobility issues, followed by environmental regulation and communication issues. The EVA was aborted, and Cernan returned to the capsule after two hours. On June 6, Gemini 9A landed, and was recovered by USSWasp.[1]: 92–95

Apollo program
After Gemini 9A, Stafford was assigned as the backup command module pilot on what was then planned as Apollo 2, withFrank Bormanas the commander andMike Collinsas the lunar module pilot. For his technical assignment, Stafford was tasked as an astronaut liaison for the development of Apollo guidance and navigation systems, as well as the command and service module. In late 1966, he was reassigned to Apollo 2 backup commander, with Apollo 10 crewmates John Young as the command module pilot and Gene Cernan as the lunar module pilot. While testing the command module, they received word of theApollo 1 fireand subsequent suspension of the Apollo program.[1]: 95–105[6]: 1–6
In the spring of 1968, Deke Slayton announced that the previous backup crew for Apollo 2 would become the primary crew for Apollo 10. In preparation for the mission, Stafford helped design a color camera to replace the grainy black-and-white video broadcast before from space; he felt that public outreach was a vital aspect of the mission.[7]Thecommand module(CM) was nicknamed "Charlie Brown"; the lunar module (LM) was nicknamed "Snoopy".[1]: 120–122
Apollo 10 lifted off on May 18, 1969. Despite heavy oscillation during ascent, Apollo 10 achieved orbit without incident, docked the LM and CM, and achieved its translunar injection burn. Upon arriving in lunar orbit, Stafford and Cernan undocked in the LM and entered an elliptical orbit with aperiapsis(the closest distance) of nine miles over the lunar surface. To provide reconnaissance, the periapsis coincided with theSea of Tranquility, the intended landing site for Apollo 11. Upon ascent, the LM began turning rapidly from a misaligned switch on the Abort Guidance System; Stafford was able to regain control and conduct the burn to rendezvous with the CM. The LM docked with the CM to return the astronauts and was jettisoned. After two days in lunar orbit, Apollo 10 began its return trajectory. Along the return, the capsule traveled at 24,791 mph (39,897 km/h), setting the record for the fastest speed by a human being. Apollo 10 splashed down east of Samoa and was recovered byUSSPrinceton.[1]: 120–135
In July 1969, Stafford replaced Alan Shepard (who had returned to flight status) asChief of the Astronaut Office. Along with Director of Flight Crew OperationsDeke Slayton, Stafford oversaw assignments to the upcoming Apollo andSkylabmissions until Shepard resumed the position afterApollo 14in July 1971. During this period, U.S. PresidentRichard Nixonand Soviet PremierAlexei Kosyginagreed to the Apollo-Soyuz Test Project (ASTP). Stafford was promoted to the rank of brigadier general in late 1972, and was soon named the commander of ASTP, along with Slayton (who had also returned to flight status) andVance Brand.[1]: 135–156
Beginning in 1973, the ASTP team trained extensively in Russia and the United States.Soyuz 19, carryingAlexei LeonovandValery Kubasov, launched on July 15, 1975, at 12:20 UTC, followed by Apollo at 19:50 UTC. After two days in space, Soyuz and Apollo docked on July 17, where the crews met and conducted joint experiments and held press conferences. After remaining docked for 44 hours, the two spacecraft undocked on July 19. Soyuz returned to Earth on July 21; Apollo remained in orbit until July 24. While descending, the Apollo command module began filling withnitrogen tetroxidefrom the reaction control thrusters. The crew donned oxygen masks, but Brand lost consciousness and had to be assisted by Stafford. All crew were safely recovered aboardUSSNew Orleans, and were hospitalized in Hawaii foredema(swelling) from fuel inhalation.[1]: 156–197

Post-NASA career
In June 1975, before ASTP, Stafford was offered command of theAir Force Flight Test Centerat Edwards AFB. He accepted and assumed the assignment on November 15, 1975. Stafford oversaw the Air Force and NASA test facilities at Edwards AFB, as well as test ranges inUtahandNevada. He continued to fly (including foreign aircraft such as theMiG-17andPanavia Tornado) and was involved in the interview ofViktor Belenkoafter his defection. Stafford also managed the development of theXST, which would later evolve into theF-117 Nighthawk. In March 1978, he was promoted to lieutenant general and became Deputy Chief of Staff, Research Development and Acquisition inWashington, D.C.While working in Washington, Stafford advocated for the creation of the mobileMX missile, and began developing theAdvanced Technology Bomber, the predecessor to theB-2 stealth bomber.[1]: 198–210
With no statement of need or requirements, Stafford pushed for and started a larger attack stealth aircraft namedSenior Trend, which was later designated the Stealth AttackF-117A.[1]: 198–210The F-117A flew in just two years and eight months after the contract withLockheedwas signed.[8]The aircraft became operational in less than five years.[9]DuringDesert Storm, it was the only plane that secured airspace aboveBaghdadon the opening night of combat in 1991.[10]The F-117A flew less than two percent of the air-to-ground combat missions, but it was responsible for attacking 43 percent of the Iraqi strategic targets.[11]
In early 1979, before giving a speech at the Chicago chapter of the Air Force Association, Stafford met with the Chairman ofNorthropwhose company had started a low-speed experimental stealth reconnaissance program forDARPAand the U.S. Army using smooth surfaces. On a piece of hotel stationery, Stafford wrote specs for range, payload, radar cross-section, and gross take-off weight for an advanced stealth technology bomber, which later became designated as theB-2. To further enhance his emphasis on stealth, he started a competition between the firms ofBoeing,General Dynamics, and also included Lockheed because of their stealth technology, to develop a stealth supercruise missile. Out of that came theAGM-129Stealth Cruise missile developed by General Dynamics. It was a 2,000 nautical mile super stealth nuclear-armed cruise missile with a W-80-1 warhead and 130 Kilotons yield. He then started theAdvanced Tactical Fighter(ATF) program to replace the F-15 (now theF-22) as an air superiority fighter. Stafford retired toNorman, Oklahoma, on November 1, 1979.[1]: 198–210
Following his retirement, Stafford served on several corporate boards, includingOmega SA, Gibraltar Exploration, andGulfstream Aerospace. He originally intended to reunite with his ASTP crewmates in Russia, but the 1979Soviet invasion of Afghanistan, and the subsequent1980 Olympics boycott, left them unable to travel to Russia. Stafford created a consulting firm, Stafford, Burke, and Hecker, with two recently retired United States Air Force general officers, Lieutenant General Kelly H. Burke, and Major General Guy L. Hecker Jr. In July 1990,Vice President QuayleandAdmiralRichard Truly, then theNASA administrator, asked Stafford to chair a committee (the "Synthesis Committee") that advised NASA on their overall effort toward long-term lunar andMarsmissions, theSpace Exploration Initiative. Stafford and his team of 42 full-time members and 150 part-time members created a long-term plan with lunar missions in 2004 and a Mars mission in 2012.[12][1]: 211–232In 1992, Stafford began work as an advisor forSpace Station Freedom, the precursor to theInternational Space Station(ISS). While coordinating Russian involvement, Stafford became a technical advisor for theShuttle–Mir program, particularlySTS-63andSTS-71. He also served on a review committee for theProgress-Mir Collision.[1]: 230–269
In 2002, Stafford published an autobiography written withMichael Cassutt, titledWe Have Capture: Tom Stafford and the Space Race.[1]He also wrote the epilogue of the 2011 bookFalling to Earth: An Apollo 15 Astronaut's Journey to the Moonby fellow Apollo astronautAl Worden.[13]
Stafford and Soviet commander Alexey Leonov, became lasting friends, with Leonov being the godfather of Stafford's younger children.[14][15]Stafford gave a eulogy in Russian at Leonov's funeral in October 2019.[16][17]

Personal life and death
In 1953, Stafford married Faye Shoemaker from Weatherford, Oklahoma. Faye and Stafford had two daughters, Dionne (born 1954) and Karin (born 1957). Faye and Stafford divorced in 1985. Stafford later married Linda Ann Dishman in December 1988.[1]: 15, 19, 216, 219They had two adopted sons, Michael Thomas and Stanislav "Stas" Patten.[4]Stafford enjoyedhunting,weight lifting,gliding,scuba diving,fishingandswimming.[4]
Stafford died fromliver cancerat a care home inSatellite Beach, Florida, on March 18, 2024, at the age of 93.[18][19]

Awards and honors
This is the greatest honor of my life. I am very proud to have contributed to our nation's future in space and I am deeply grateful for the opportunity to have participated in the beginning of America's venture into the new and endless frontier.
— Upon receiving the Congressional Space Medal of Honor.[20]
