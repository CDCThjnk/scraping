Eileen Marie Collins(born 19 November 1956) is an American retiredNASAastronautandAir Forcecolonel. A flight instructor andtest pilot, Collins was the first woman to pilot theSpace Shuttleand the first to command a Space Shuttle mission.
A graduate ofCorning Community College, where she earned an associate degree in mathematics in 1976, andSyracuse University, where she graduated with aBachelor of Artsdegree in mathematics and economics in 1978, Collins was commissioned as an officer in the USAF through Syracuse'sAir Force Reserve Officer Training Corpsprogram. She was one of four women chosen forUndergraduate Pilot TrainingatVance Air Force Base,Oklahoma. After earning herpilot wings, she stayed on at Vance for three years as aT-38 Taloninstructor pilot before transitioning to theC-141 StarlifteratTravis Air Force Base,California. During theU.S. invasion of Grenadain October 1983, her aircraft flew troops of the82nd Airborne Divisionfrom (then)Pope Air Force BaseinNorth CarolinatoGrenada, and took thirty-six medical students back. From 1986 to 1989, she was an assistant professor in mathematics and aT-41instructor pilot at theU.S. Air Force AcademyinColorado. She earned a Master of Science degree inoperations researchfromStanford Universityin 1986, and a Master of Arts degree in space systems management fromWebster Universityin 1989. That year, she became the second woman pilot to attend theUSAF Test Pilot School, graduating with class 89B.
In 1990, Collins was selected to be a pilot astronaut withNASA Astronaut Group 13. She flew the Space Shuttle as the pilot of the 1995STS-63mission, which involved aspace rendezvousbetweenSpace ShuttleDiscoveryand the Russian space stationMir. She was also the pilot forSTS-84in 1997. She became the first woman to command a US spacecraft withSTS-93, which launched in July 1999 and deployed theChandra X-Ray Observatory. In 2005 she commandedSTS-114, NASA's "return to flight" mission after theSpace ShuttleColumbiadisaster, to test safety improvements, and resupply theInternational Space Station(ISS). During this mission she became the first astronaut to fly theSpace Shuttle orbiterthrough a complete360-degree pitch maneuverso astronauts aboard the ISS could take photographs of its belly to ensure there was no threat from debris-related damage during re-entry. She retired from the USAF in January 2005 with the rank ofcolonel, and from NASA in May 2006.

Early life
Eileen Marie Collins was born inElmira, New York, on 19 November 1956.[1]Her parents were James Edward Collins and his wife Rose MarienéeO'Hara.[2][3]Her father's ancestors came to the United States fromCounty Corkin Ireland in the mid-1800s, settling inPennsylvaniaand Elmira, New York.[4][5]She had three siblings: an older brother, a younger sister, and a younger brother.[6]Her father served in theUS Navyin thePacific Theaterduring World War II. After the war he managed the family bar, and then became asurveyor. Her parents separated when she was young, and her mother took a job as astenographerat theElmira Correctional Facility. As a child, Collins was shy and needed speech therapy for her stutter.[5]She joined theGirl Scouts.[7]She expressed an early interest in becoming a pilot, subscribing toAir Force Magazineand reading books about World War II-era military aviators such asFate Is the HunterandGod Is My Co-Pilot.[8][9][10]
Collins attended St. Patrick's School in Elmira up to theeighth gradeand thenNotre Dame High School, a Catholic high school,[5][11]but was unhappy there. The family home was badly damaged by flooding caused byHurricane Agnesin June 1972, and with finances tight, she was able to convince her mother to allow her to transfer toElmira Free Academy, a public high school. After graduating from Elmira Free Academy in 1974, Collins considered enlisting in theUS Air Force, but her father was adamantly opposed.[12]Instead, she attendedCorning Community College, where she earned an associate degree in mathematics in 1976. She then enteredSyracuse University, which she chose because it had anAir Force Reserve Officer Training Corps(AFROTC) program.[13][14]
In 1975, theUnited States Air Force(USAF) changed its policy to allow women to train as pilots, although only for non-combat missions. The first ten women chosen for pilot training in September 1976 were all serving Air Force officers with four-year college degrees. They graduated in September 1977. Collins noted their names and followed their progress and subsequent careers with interest, hoping to soon follow in their footsteps.[15][16]
Six weeks after graduating from Corning, Collins reported to (then)Rickenbacker Air Force Basefor her basic training. Women haddifferent fitness standardsfrom men, but Collins was granted permission to do the morning run with the men, who had to run 12 furlongs (2.4 km) in less than 12 minutes.[17]The training included classes on the history of the USAF and the theory of flight, a ride in aFairchild C-123 Provider, and a flight in aCessna T-37 Tweetwith an instructor. She took flying lessons in aCessna 150atElmira Corning Regional Airport, eventually flying solo, but did not have time to complete all the requirements for aprivate pilot license.[17]
In January 1978, Collins received orders to report toOffutt Air Force Baseupon graduation from Syracuse, to become a computer systems engineer. Before this could occur, the Syracuse AFROTC commander, Colonel Vernon Hagen, informed her that the USAF was now accepting up to ten women from AFROTC programs for pilot training; the first ten women graduated on 2 September 1977.[18][19]He offered to put her name forward. Collins eagerly accepted the offer, but a physical examination atHancock Field Air National Guard Baserevealed that although she had 20/20visual acuityin her right eye, she had only 20/25 in the left, leading to her being rejected. Hagen told her to rest her eyes, and ordered a re-test, which she passed.[19]She graduated later that year with aBachelor of Artsin mathematics and economics.[20][21]

Air Force career
Upon graduation from Syracuse, Collins was commissioned as asecond lieutenantin the USAF. She received orders to report toLackland Air Force BaseinTexasfor the Flight Screening Program (FSP) In August 1978. She was one of four women in the class; there were ten men.[22]The purpose of the FSP was to screen out unsuitable pilots before sending them to the more expensiveUndergraduate Pilot Training(UPT) program.[23]Collins was almost eliminated on medical grounds due to her left eye and a suspectedheart murmur, but was cleared to fly. Training flights were conducted from nearbyHondo Municipal AirportinCessna T-41 Mescaleroaircraft.[22][24]
For her UPT, Collins requested that she be assigned toWilliams Air Force BaseinArizona, where the first ten women had trained,[15][25]but the USAF personnel office decided to send her toVance Air Force BaseinEnid, Oklahoma. There were three other women in her class, 79–08. She decorated her helmet with the logo E = mc2, an allusion to both her initials andAlbert Einstein'smass–energy equivalenceequation. Flight training was conducted in the T-37 Tweet.[25]On 24 November 1978, she became the first member of her class to fly solo.[26]
The second phase of instruction began in March 1979 in theNorthrop T-38 Talon, ajet trainer. She received herpilot wingsat the conclusion of this training, and was selected to become a flight instructor.[27]There remained some training before she could join an operational unit. First, there was a week ofSurvival, Evasion, Resistance, and Escapetraining.[28]The top-ranking members of the class went on to fly single-pilot aircraft, while the others became co-pilots. Most single-pilot aircraft were combat aircraft, which woman could not yet fly, so she stayed on at Vance as aT-38 Taloninstructor pilot. This involved four weeks of pilot instructor training, which was conducted atRandolph Air Force BaseinSan Antonio, Texas.[29]She was the first woman to become a T-38 instructor pilot,[26]and the only woman flight instructor at Vance between September 1979 and December 1982.[30]
Now acaptain, Collins set her sights on becoming anastronaut. To achieve this goal, she aimed to graduate from theUSAF Test Pilot School. Entry required at least one year as an aircraft commander in an operational aircraft and over one thousand hours flying time. She had already accumulated over a thousand hours flying as an instructor at Vance, but the USAF does not consider a trainer an operational aircraft, unlike a fighter, bomber, reconnaissance, transport, or refueling aircraft. Collins requested an assignment flying theConvair F-106 Delta Dart,McDonnell Douglas F-4 Phantom II, orFairchild Republic A-10 Thunderbolt II, but women were still not permitted to fly combat aircraft, so she was assigned toTravis Air Force BaseinCalifornia, to fly theLockheed C-141 Starlifter, a transport aircraft that had been her 21st choice, as a co-pilot. She flew long-range missions such as the "Double Diego" run toDiego GarciaviaHickam Air Force BaseinHawaii,Andersen Air Force BaseonGuam, andClark Air Basein the Philippines. The aircraft then flew to Clark and Diego Garcia again, before heading homeward via Singapore,Kadena Air BaseonOkinawa,Yokota Air Basein Japan andElmendorf Air Force BaseinAlaska. She also flew the "coral run" toKwajalein Atoll,Wake Island,Johnston Atoll, andMidway Atoll, and to European destinations in Germany, Spain, Italy, Turkey, and the United Kingdom in support of the annualReforger exercises.[31]
During the invasion of Grenada in October 1983, her aircraft flew troops of the82nd Airborne Divisionfrom (then)Pope Air Force BaseinNorth CarolinatoGrenada, and took thirty-six medical students back. Although women were not supposed to fly in combat, the USAF gave her combat pay for the mission,[32][33]and awarded her theArmed Forces Expeditionary Medal.[34]After nine months as a co-pilot, she was upgraded to first pilot. After attending aircraft commander school atAltus Air Force Basein Oklahoma, andaerial refuelingtraining, she was upgraded to aircraft commander in June 1984.[32]
From August 1986 to June 1989, Collins was assigned to theUnited States Air Force AcademyinColorado, where she was an assistant professor in mathematics, teaching courses oncalculusandlinear algebra, and a T-41 instructor pilot.[33][35]Through theAir Force Institute of Technology, she earned aMaster of Scienceinoperations researchfromStanford Universityin 1986,[34][35]and aMaster of Artsin space systems management fromWebster Universityin 1989.[3]She had begun dating a fellow C-141 pilot,[36]James P. (Pat) Youngs, in August 1983.[3]Youngs was also posted to the Air Force Academy, as agolfinstructor. They were married on 1 August 1987. Youngs eventually left the USAF to fly as a commercial pilot forDelta Air Lines, thereby giving himself the flexibility to follow Collins as her career progressed.[36]
Earning an advanced degree improved her chances of being selected for the USAF Test Pilot School atEdwards Air Force Basein California, but USAF rules required officers to pay back their tuition by serving with the duty assignment that provided the funding. This meant that she was supposed to remain at the Air Force Academy for three years. She hoped that this rule would be waived, but her first two applications for the USAF Test Pilot School were rejected on these grounds. When she applied for a third time in 1989, she had been in the USAF for longer than the ten-year maximum allowed before entering the USAF Test Pilot School, but this time a waiver was granted.[37]In the meantime, Captain Jacquelyn Susan "Jackie" Parker became the first woman to graduate from the USAF Test Pilot School in 1988.[38]
Collins became the second woman pilot to attend when she joined Class 89B in June 1989.[39][40]She was also the most senior member of the class, as she was the only one with the rank ofmajor, which made her the class leader.[39]At Edwards she flew several types of aircraft, including theLockheed TR-1,P-3 Orion, andC-130 Hercules, thede Havilland Canada UV-18 Twin Otter, theBoeing KC-135 Stratotanker,Cessna A-37 Dragonfly,Learjet 24,Beechcraft King Air,General Dynamics F-16 Fighting Falcon, andF-111,McDonnell Douglas F-4 Phantom II,Vought A-7 Corsair II, and theGoodyear Blimp.[41]She graduated in June 1990.[42]

Astronaut career

Selection and training
On 17 April 1989, theNational Air and Space Administration(NASA) announced that it was selecting another class of astronauts.[43]Collins's application was one of nearly 2,500 received by the 30 June 1989 deadline, of which 1,945 met the minimum requirements for pilots ormission specialists.[44]Because she had not yet graduated from the USAF Test Pilot School, the USAF submitted her application as one for a mission specialist.[45]NASA convened a selection board chaired by the Director of Flight Crew Operations,Don Puddy, which also includedCarolyn Huntoon, the Director of Life Sciences; Joseph Atkinson, the Chief of Equal Opportunity Programs;[44]and astronautsJohn Young,Charles Bolden,Hoot Gibson,Rhea Seddon,Jerry Ross, andMary Cleave.[46]
In September 1989, Collins received a call from Duane Ross, the selection board's administrative officer, inviting her to come to theJohnson Space Center(JSC) with the second of five groups of hopefuls for a week of interviews, examinations, medical evaluations, and orientation, commencing on 2 October 1989.[47][48]Once again, her eyesight proved a problem; she failed the depth perception test, but the doctor allowed her to take an alternative test, which she passed.[49]On 16 January 1990, she saw a note on the message board asking her to call Duane Ross. When she called she was put through to John Young, who informed her that she had been selected. When he asked if she had any questions, she asked if she was to be a pilot or a mission specialist. Young laughed and told her: "Pilot! Yes, pilot. You will be the first woman to pilot theSpace Shuttle!"[50]
Collins's selection as one of the twenty-threeastronaut candidates(ASCANs) inNASA Astronaut Group 13was publicly announced on 17 January 1990.[3]The group called themselves the "Hairballs".[51]She reported for duty at JSC on 16 July 1990, after graduating from the USAF Test Pilot School. She knew one other member of the group well:Susan Helmshad been a fellow assistant professor at the Air Force Academy and graduate student at Stanford.[52]Pilot ASCANs honed their skills flying the T-38, an aircraft with which Collins was already familiar. They attended classes on the Space Shuttle and its systems, and trained in a low-fidelity simulator. Land survival training was conducted atFairchild Air Force BaseinWashington, water survival training atNaval Air Station PensacolainFlorida, and parachute training at Vance Air Force Base. Although their training was intended to take a year, the ASCANs were moved on to operational roles after nine months. Collins was assigned toorbitersystems, with particular responsibility for theauxiliary power units.[53]
After nine months in this assignment, Collins was sent to theKennedy Space Center(KSC) in Florida as an astronaut support person (ASP), also known as a Cape Crusader. This was another routine assignment that astronauts did to familiarize them with the Space Shuttle's systems and procedures. ASPs handled the checkout of the systems in the hangar and on the launch pad. As members of the KSC closeout crew, they strapped the astronauts into their seats before takeoff, and helped them out again after landing. Collins spent sixteen months as an ASP, assisting with ten Space Shuttle missions between February 1992 and June 1993. After so long away from JSC, her skills in the simulator had become rusty, so theChief of the Astronaut Office, Hoot Gibson, returned her to JSC for duty as acapsule communicator(CAPCOM).[54]

STS-63
Collins first flew the Space Shuttle as pilot in 1995 aboardSTS-63. This was the first time a woman had piloted the Space Shuttle.[55]Delays in the flight schedule meant that she was the second-last member of her class to fly in space.[56]Two more women pilots joined the Astronaut Corps in 1995 withNASA Astronaut Group 15:Pamela MelroyandSusan Still. They would be the only other women to pilot the Space Shuttle in its thirty-year history.[57]
The STS-63 mission included aspace rendezvousbetween theSpace ShuttleDiscoveryand the Russian space stationMir. This was the first time a Space Shuttle made an approach and flyaround ofMir, although it did not dock. The crew included acosmonaut,Vladimir Georgiyevich Titov, who had lived onMirfor a year. He became the second cosmonaut to fly on the Space Shuttle.[55]
In preparation for the mission, Collins flew over 500 approaches and landings in theShuttle Training Aircraft(STA), a NASA training vehicle that duplicated the orbiter's approach profile and handling qualities. The crew paid a visit to Russia and visitedStar Cityand aircraft and spacecraft museums in the Moscow area, and sat in the cockpit of theBuranspacecraft, the Russian equivalent of the Space Shuttle.[56]On Collins's invitation, seven of the surviving members of theMercury 13attended the launch on 3 February 1995.[58]
A series of thruster burns broughtDiscoveryinto line withMir. The mission plan called for an approach to no less than 10 meters (11 yd) ofMir, followed by a flyaround. This was delayed by problems with three of the orbiter's 44Reaction Control System(RCS) thrusters, which sprang leaks. Some thrusters could be shut off, but one thruster, R1U, was required for rendezvous, and could not. Eventually all its contents leaked into space and it was safe to approachMir.[55]
As well as rendezvousing withMir,Discoverycarried theSpacehab moduleand the SPARTAN-204 astronomy satellite.[55]Collins had never experiencedairsickness, but felt nauseous. This was remedied by aPhenerganshot, but she only ateChexon the first three days, taking dinner for the first time on the fourth.[59]Her responsibilities included running the Fluids Generic Bioprocessing Apparatus-1 (FGBA-1), aCoca-Coladispensing machine. Astronauts rated control samples before and after flight.[60]Discoverylanded back at KSC on 11 February 1995, after 8 days, 6 hours, and 28 minutes in flight.[55]
Soon after returning from space, Collins became pregnant. Her first child, Bridget, was born nine months later.[57][61]

STS-84
In August 1995, Collins was assigned to her second mission,STS-84. This mission would dock withMir, leave astronautMichael Foalebehind for a four-month stay, and return with astronautJerry Linengerat the conclusion of his stay onMir. Foale had been with Collins on the STS-63 mission. This time the cosmonaut on the mission would beYelena Kondakova, who had spent 169 days onMirbetween October 1994 to March 1995 as part of theMirEO-17mission. Collins had glimpsed her during the STS-63 mission. The mission commander,Charles Precourt, spoke Russian fluently. The crew also included a FrenchESAastronaut,Jean-François Clervoy.[62][63]
The STS-84 mission used theSpace ShuttleAtlantis, which had a reputation as the least troublesome orbiter, and for this mission carried two Spacehab modules instead of just one.[62][63]In preparation for the mission, Collins completed one hundred hours of Russian language classroom training, but she usually relied on Precourt translating for her. The crew traveled to Star City to studyMir's systems and had dinner at the home of Kondakova and her husband, cosmonautValeri Ryumin, now the president ofEnergia, the Russian space agency.[64]
Atlantislifted off from KSC on 15 May 1997. For Collins, it was the first and only time a launch had occurred without delays. Nor were there any leaking thrusters;Atlantisdocked withMirwithout incident the next day. This time, Collins felt no nausea. Crew members were exchanged, and 7,300 pounds (3,300 kg) of equipment, spare parts, experiments, and supplies were transferred toMir, of which 1,000 pounds (450 kg) was water.[65]
Collins spent most of the time filling bags with drinking water.[66]She also carried out a photographic survey of the exterior ofMirthrough portholes onMirand the overhead windows onAtlantis's flight deck.[67]TheMirEO-23mission commander,Vasily Tsibliyevproduced a small bottle ofCourvoisiercognac, and everyone had a couple of sips. Alcohol consumption was banned on the Space Shuttle, but not onMir.[66]The rest of the mission was taken up conducting experiments. Collins photographedComet Hale–Bopp, the brightest comet seen in the sky for many years.[68]Atlantisreturned to KSC on 24 May after a flight lasting 9 days, 23 hours, and 20 minutes.[65]

STS-93
The usual practice at this time was for a pilot astronaut to fly two missions as a pilot and then go on to command a mission. Collins had heard of theAdvanced X-ray Astrophysics Facility(AXAF) and indicated to the Chief of the Astronaut Office,Bob Cabana, that she was interested in flying the mission to deploy it. A few months later, JSC deputy directorJim Wetherbeeand directorGeorge Abbeyinformed her that she was to be assigned to the mission,[69]which was designatedSTS-93. This would be the first time that a woman commanded a Space Shuttle mission, so the official announcement of her assignment was made by thefirst lady,Hillary Rodham Clinton, in theRoosevelt Roomof the White House on 5 March 1998.[70]
Jeffrey Ashby, a rookie astronaut, was assigned as Collins's pilot. To deploy the AXAF, she had NASA mission specialist astronautCady Colemanand FrenchCNESastronautMichel Tognini. Originally,Winston E. Scottwas to be the second mission specialist, but NASA headquarters wanted an astronomer with experience with theinertial upper stage(IUS) that would deploy the AXAF.Steven Hawleywas the only available astronaut who met both these requirements. Hawley was a very senior astronaut who had been selected withNASA Astronaut Group 8in 1978, and had helped deploy theHubble Space Telescopein 1990 and service it in 1997. Collins was apprehensive that Hawley would attempt to command the mission. Her fears proved groundless; Hawley offered wisdom and advice but made no attempt to interfere with Collins's command of the mission.[71]
The STS-93 mission was not routine. TheSpace ShuttleColumbiahad to be used because its airlock was inside the crew compartment instead of the payload bay. This meant that it was the only orbiter that could accommodate the AXAF and the IUS. Initially scheduled for January 1999, the launch date was delayed due to an investigation of a failed USAFTitan IVlaunch using the IUS and problems that were discovered during testing of the AXAF (now named theChandra X-ray Observatory). This pushed the launch date back to April and then to July, whenColumbiawas scheduled for fifteen months' maintenance inPalmdale, California.[72]
Because the AXAF weighed 30,852 pounds (13,994 kg) and the IUS weighed 12,930 pounds (5,860 kg), this was the heaviest payload ever launched by the Space Shuttle. To save weight, the crew was reduced to five members, and consumables to those needed for a five-day mission.[72]This made it the shortest scheduled mission since 1990.[73]Two of the five pairs of tanks holdinghydrogenandoxygenfor thefuel cellswere removed, as was therobotic arm, so any problems had to be resolved in the payload bay, as the Chandra could not be retrieved. The large mass shiftedColumbia'scenter of gravity, rendering a landing after an emergency abort extremely hazardous.[72]
The launch day of 20 July 1999, coincided with the thirtieth anniversary of theApollo 11Moon landing mission, so former astronautsNeil Armstrong,Buzz Aldrin, andMichael Collinswere at KSC to watch the launch. Observers also included Hillary Clinton and theUnited States women's national soccer team, who had recently won the1999 FIFA Women's World Cup.[74]The launch countdown proceeded smoothly untilColumbia's hazardous gas detection system highlighted an unacceptably high hydrogen concentration in the aft engine compartment, and the countdown was halted less than half a second before theSpace Shuttle main engines(SSMEs) were to have started.[73]Had they been started, they would have had to be replaced, which would have taken a month, pushing it into the scheduled maintenance window.[75]
There was no fuel leak; the sensor was faulty. The launch was rescheduled for two days later. It then had to be postponed a further day due to bad weather. On the third launch attempt, there was a seven-minute delay due to a communications problem, butColumbialifted off at last on 23 July. One of the main engine controllers failed during takeoff, and one of the main engines cut out prematurely. As a result, the orbit reached was 7 miles (11 km) lower than intended but the situation could have been much worse; the engine problem was caused by a pin that had come loose and struck the nozzle, rupturing three liquid hydrogen coolant tubes. Had the controller not been faulty, it might have pumped more liquid oxygen and caused the engine to explode.[73][76]After the flight, faults were found not just inColumbia, but inDiscoveryandEndeavouras well, and the whole Space Shuttle fleet was grounded until December.[77]
Columbiaeventually reached the proper orbit and the Chandra X-ray Observatory was successfully deployed. For the remainder of the mission, the crew used the Southwest Ultraviolet Imaging System (SWUIS) to take ultraviolet images of the Earth, the Moon, Mercury, Venus, and Jupiter.[73]Collins used theShuttle Amateur Radio Experiment(SAREX) to talk to children onamateur radio stationswith her call sign KD5EDS. On 27 July, Collins broughtColumbiain for a night landing, the twelfth of the Space Shuttle program.[78]The flight had lasted 4 days, 22 hours, and 50 minutes.[73]She was awarded theDistinguished Flying Crossfor this mission.[79]
After a flight astronauts usually carried out a publicity tour. Collins appeared with Coleman onThe Tonight Show with Jay Lenoon 16 August. She opened theNew York Stock Exchangeon 7 January 2000, and appeared on theOprah Winfreyshow on 25 April 2000. She had a miscarriage in November 1999, but a son, Luke, was born in November 2000.[80]

STS-114
After the STS-84 mission, Collins had become the head of the Vehicle Systems Branch of the Astronaut Office, which she had renamed the Spacecraft Systems Branch, as the scope of its work now included theInternational Space Station(ISS) as well as the Space Shuttle. She relinquished this position on being assigned to command STS-93. After returning from that mission, she became the chief information officer at the Astronaut Office. In that role she automated the scheduling system, an initiative of the new Chief of the Astronaut Office, Charles Precourt. She then became the chief of the Space Shuttle Branch, remaining in this role until November 2000, when she left on maternity leave. On returning to work in January 2001, she became the chief of the Safety Branch, replacingRick Husband, who left to command theSTS-107mission. In turn, Collins handed over the position toDom Goriewhen she was assigned to commandSTS-114in late 2001.[81]
The STS-114 mission involved dockingAtlantiswith the ISS to transfer crewmen and supplies.Jim Kellywas assigned as the mission's pilot andStephen Robinsonand JapaneseJAXAastronautSoichi Noguchiwere assigned as mission specialists. The mission would takeExpedition 7to the ISS and bringExpedition 6back. Some 1,100 cubic feet (31 m3) of supplies would be transferred to the ISS from theMulti-Purpose Logistics Module, which would then be filled with experiments, equipment that was no longer required, and garbage to be returned to Earth. Three spacewalks were scheduled, to install an external stowage platform on the ISSQuestJoint Airlockand to replace a gyroscope that had failed. Collins was concerned about the proposed workload; she knew from her experience on STS-93 that a hectic schedule and pressure to get things done often resulted in mistakes.[82][83]
Problems discovered with the propellant feed lines onAtlantisand then onDiscoveryin June 2002 led to the entire Space Shuttle fleet being grounded again until October, pushing the launch date back to 6 March 2003. The fleet was then grounded again after theSpace ShuttleColumbiadisasterin February 2003.[84]STS-114 now became NASA's "return to flight" mission to test safety improvements in addition to resupplying the ISS.[85]The crew remained the same, but instead of the ISS expedition crew members, STS-114 would take three additional mission specialists to handle the greater workload:Andy Thomasto coordinate thespacewalksandWendy Lawrenceto operate the robotic arm,[86]which was equipped with specialized cameras so that the Space Shuttle could be surveyed for damage.[87]STS-114 was already scheduled to be the next mission flown, but it is unlikely that it would have remained so if Collins and Kelly had not already flown a mission as commander and pilot respectively. Collins advocated for at least one rookie astronaut to be assigned to the flight, andCharles Camardawas added.[88]
Rick Hauck, who had commanded the return to flight mission after theSpace ShuttleChallengerdisaster, advised her to visit the contractors where the Space Shuttle components were made. She visited theRockwell Internationalplant inCanoga Park, California, where the SSMEs were refurbished, theThiokolfactory inBrigham City, Utah, where thesolid rocket boosters(SRBs) were made, and theMichoud Assembly FacilityinNew Orleans, Louisiana, where theSpace Shuttle external tankwas assembled.[89]Asked if she felt afraid after the loss ofColumbia, Collins replied: "I would have to say no. I want to fly again. I am very mentally ready to go fly again." Then pausing, noting that she wanted to be precise, she added "I am mentally ready to go fly again when the shuttle is cleared to fly."[90]
She expressed reservations about the studs that held the Space Shuttle in place on the launch pad. The bolts holding them were supposed to be ruptured by explosive charges on lift off, but not all had done so on every mission; nuts had failed to rupture on one in five missions. If too many failed to separate, the result could be catastrophic. A new detonator system was devised, but would not be available for STS-114. She also had concerns about thebooster separation motorsthat separated the SRBs from the orbiter. These were redesigned for STS-114. Finally, she expressed concern aboutrudder/speed brake(RSB)actuators. An inspection of the RSB actuators onDiscoveryrevealed problems; these were rectified by taking parts fromEndeavour. Since it would take a month to inspectAtlantis,Discoverywas substituted forAtlantisfor the STS-114 mission.[91]
Discoverywas rolled out to the launch pad on 6 April 2005, but problems with the sensors in the external tank led to it being taken back to theVehicle Assembly Buildingat KSC to swap the external tank. This pushed the launch date back to 13 July. Then the same problem recurred, causing another postponement.[92]The mission was launched on 26 July 2005, after a flawless countdown.[85]AlthoughDiscoverywas not damaged, video of the launch revealed that the problem with debris striking the Space Shuttle had not been resolved.[93]Ten pieces of foam had broken off the external tank during liftoff, including a 92-by-279-by-17-centimeter (36.3 in × 110 in × 6.7 in) piece that was the largest ever recorded. This was the problem that had doomedColumbia, and it had evidently not been fixed.[94]Collins blamed herself for not pushing Michoud harder to effect changes.[95]
The STS-114 mission continued, asDiscoverywas already in orbit, but the Space Shuttle fleet was grounded again.[93]Collins became the first astronaut to fly an orbiter through a complete360-degree pitch maneuver. This was necessary so the astronauts aboard the ISS could take photographs ofDiscovery's belly to ensure there was no threat from debris-related damage to the orbiter upon reentry. It was a difficult maneuver, but one that she had practised many times in the simulator. She then flew under the ISS and docked with it.[96]The inspections revealed some concerns: gap fillers were protruding between some of the tiles, which could cause them to pop out during re-entry.[97]The three spacewalks and the transfer of supplies were carried out without problems.[85]On the third spacewalk, Robinson rode the robotic arm to the underside ofDiscoveryand removed the two most prominent protruding gap fillers.[97]
Discoverywas supposed to land at KSC on 8 August but unfavorable weather led to a postponement until the next day, and the landing site was changed to Edwards Air Force Base.Discoverytouched down after a mission lasting 13 days, 21 hours, and 33 minutes.[85]This time, Collins was unhappy with her landing, feeling that it was slightly fast. She was relieved to find that the tires were in good shape. Although she had felt well in space on this mission, her feet hurt as the bones moved back into position back on the ground, and the pain took two weeks to subside.[98]

Later life
Collins retired from the U.S. Air Force in January 2005 with the rank ofcolonel.[1]On 1 May 2006, NASA announced that she was leaving NASA to spend more time with her family and pursue other interests.[99]She had flown 6,751 hours in thirty different types of aircraft, and logged over 872 hours in space flights.[1]
After her retirement from the USAF and NASA, Collins served on the Board of Directors ofUSAA, a San Antonio banking and insurance company, from 2006 to 2021.[100][101]She remained involved with NASA, as chair of the Space Operations Committee of the NASA Advisory Council[102]from 2007 to 2011.[103]
Collins also made occasional public appearances as an analyst covering Shuttle launches and landings forCNN.[104]She was the commencement speaker at the 148th commencement of Syracuse University in May 2001.[20][105]She addressed the2016 Republican National ConventioninCleveland, Ohio, on 20 July 2016,[106]leading to speculation thatDonald Trumpmight appoint herNASA administrator.[107]

Awards and honors
As well as USAF Command Pilot (Astronaut) wings, Collins's awards and decorations include theLegion of Merit,[79]theDistinguished Flying Cross, theDefense Meritorious Service Medal,Meritorious Service Medalwith anoak leaf cluster, theAir Force Commendation Medalwith an oak leaf cluster,[1]theNASA Outstanding Leadership Medal,NASA Exceptional Service Medal, and fourNASA Space Flight Medals.[108]She received the Golden Plate Award of theAmerican Academy of Achievementin 2001,[109]the Free Spirit Award,[110]National Space Trophy,[111]andAdler PlanetariumWomen in Space Science Award in 2006,[112]theSpace FoundationDouglas S. MorrowPublic Outreach Award in 2007,[113]theHarmon Trophyin 2020,[114]and theWright Brothers Memorial Trophyin 2022.[115][116]
Collins was inducted into the National Women's Hall Of Fame in 1995,[117]theNational Aviation Hall of Famein 2009,[118]theUnited States Astronaut Hall of Fameon 19 April 2013,[119]and the Texas Aviation Hall Of Fame at theLone Star Flight MuseuminHouston, Texas, on 6 May 2020.[120][121]She was recognized by theEncyclopædia Britannicaas one of 300 women who have changed the world.[122]
An astronomical observatory—theEileen Collins Observatoryrun by Corning Community College—is named in her honor,[123]as is the main entrance boulevard toSyracuse Hancock International Airport.[124]One of her graduate school alma maters, Webster University, awarded her anhonoraryDoctor of Sciencein 1996,[125]and in 2021, she received Syracuse University's highest alumni honor, the George Arents Award.[126]University College Dublinof theNational University of Irelandalso conferred an honorary Doctor of Science degree on her on 14 June 2006.[127]She was awarded withWright Brothers Memorial Trophyin 2022.[128]
