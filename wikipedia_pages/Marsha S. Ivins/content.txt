In 1984, Ivins was selected as an astronaut candidate.
She has flown aboard five space missions:STS-32(1990),STS-46(1992),STS-62(1994),STS-81(1997), andSTS-98(2001).[2][3]Ivins retired from NASA on December 31, 2010.

Spaceflight experience
STS-32(January 9–20, 1990) launched from theKennedy Space Center, Florida, on an eleven-day flight, during which crew members on board theSpace ShuttleColumbiasuccessfully deployed a Syncomsatellite, and retrieved the 21,400-poundLong Duration Exposure Facility(LDEF). Mission duration was 261 hours, 1 minute, and 38 seconds. Following 173 orbits of the Earth and 4.5 million miles,Columbiareturned with a night landing at Edwards Air Force Base, California.[4]
STS-46(July 31 – August 8, 1992) was an 8-day mission, during which crew members deployed theEURECA(European Retrievable Carrier) satellite, and conducted the first Tethered Satellite System (TSS) test flight. Mission duration was 191 hours, 16 minutes, and 7 seconds.Space ShuttleAtlantisand her crew launched and landed at the Kennedy Space Center, Florida, completing 126 orbits of the Earth in 3.35 million miles.[5]
STS-62(March 4–18, 1994) was a 14-day mission for the United States Microgravity Payload (USMP) 2 and Office of Aeronautics and Space Technology (OAST) 2 payloads. These payloads studied the effects of microgravity on materials sciences and other space flight technologies. Other experiments on board included demonstration of advanced teleoperator tasks using the remote manipulator system,proteincrystal growth, and dynamic behavior of space structures. Mission duration was 312 hours, 23 minutes, and 16 seconds. Space ShuttleColumbialaunched and landed at the Kennedy Space Center, Florida, completing 224 orbits in 5.82 million miles.[6]
STS-81Atlantis(January 12–22, 1997) was a 10-day mission, the fifth to dock with Russia's Space StationMir, and the second to exchange U.S. astronauts. The mission also carried theSpacehabdouble module providing additional middeck locker space for secondary experiments. In five days of docked operations more than three tons of food, water, experiment equipment and samples were moved back and forth between the two spacecraft. Following 160 orbits of the Earth, the STS-81 mission concluded with a landing on Kennedy Space Center's Runway 33 ending a 3.9 million mile journey. Mission duration was 244 hours, 56 minutes.[7]
STS-98Atlantis(February 7–20, 2001) continued the task of building and enhancing the International Space Station by delivering the U.S. laboratory moduleDestiny. The Shuttle spent seven days docked to the station while Destiny was attached and three spacewalks were conducted to complete its assembly. The crew also relocated a docking port, and delivered supplies and equipment to the resident Expedition-1 crew. Space ShuttleAtlantisreturned to land atEdwards Air Force Base, California traveling 5.3 million miles in 203 orbits. Mission duration was 12 days, 21 hours, 20 minutes.[8]
