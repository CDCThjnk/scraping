She has flown more than 3,000 hours and among her merits she was awarded with theDefense Superior Service Medal.[1][2]

Biography
Kilrain was born on October 24, 1961, inAugusta, Georgia. She is the only sister among nine siblings. During her childhood she expressed her interest in becoming an astronaut and her family supported her dream. She started flying in high school where she had a month off during her senior year and completed training to become a private pilot.[3][4]
Kilrain graduated from theWalnut Hill School,Natick, Massachusetts, in 1979. In 1982, she obtained a bachelor's degree inaeronautical engineeringfromEmbry-Riddle Aeronautical University. She received her master of science degree in aerospace engineering fromGeorgia Institute of Technologyin 1985. During her time in graduate school she worked as a Wind Tunnel Project Officer for Lockheed Corporation.[1]
In January 1985, she had the chance to speak withDick Scobee, who one year later died as commander of theChallenger STS-51-L. Scobee advised that she should join the military as a pilot if she wanted to increase her chances of being accepted into the astronaut program. In 1985, she joined the US Navy. She quickly realized that the Navy was not an organisation that was friendly to women and that it was reluctant to accept her. She was quoted as saying:[5]
I realized that I was a woman in a man's world, so I was going to be an outsider. My whole philosophy was not to make waves. My goal was to be an astronaut. I wanted to fit in without accepting unacceptable behavior.
Susan served as the Legislative Specialist for Shuttle for the Office of Legislative Affairs at NASA Headquarters in Washington D.C. She retired from the Astronaut Office in December 2002 and from the US Navy later in 2005.[5]
Since her retirement she works as a motivational speaker. She has participated in the space camp namedSpace 2101in 2022 at the Dubai International Academy (DIA) Al Barsha, and in 2023 atKing Abdullah University of Science and Technology. During the space camp in Dubai 2,299 students representing 108 nationalities, from five schools achieved a Guinness Book of World Record forthe world's largest space exploration lesson across multiple venues.[6][7][8][9]

Personal life
She is married to Vice AdmiralColin J. Kilrain. The couple has four children and reside inVirginia Beach, Virginia. She loves photography and traveling, as well as martial arts, triathlon and playing the piano.[1][3]
With the space historianFrancis French, Kilrain co-authored a children's book namedAn Unlikely Astronaut.[2]

Military career
Kilrain was commissioned into theUS Navyin 1985. In 1987, she was designated aNaval Aviator. She was selected to be a flight instructor in theTA-4J Skyhawk. Later she flewEA-6AElectric Intruders for Tactical Electronic Warfare Squadron 33 (VAQ-33) in Key West, Florida. Upon completing theUS Naval Test Pilot Schoolat NAS Patuxent River, Maryland, she reported to Fighter Squadron 101 (VF-101) in Virginia Beach, Virginia, forF-14 Tomcattraining. Throughout her career, has logged over 3,000 flight hours in more than 30 different aircraft.[1][4]

NASA career
In 1995, she was selected by NASA as part of the 15th Astronaut Training Group. The group was selected to provide pilots, engineers, and astronauts for space shuttle flights. After a year of training, she worked on technical issues for the Vehicle Systems and Operations Branch of the Astronaut Office. She also served as spacecraft communicator (CAPCOM) in mission control during launch and entry for numerous missions.[5][10]
In 1997, she flew to space twice as a shuttle pilot on the missionsSTS-83(April 4 to 8, 1997) andSTS-94(July 1 to 17, 1997). The STS-83 mission delivered to space a Microgravity Science Laboratory (MSL-1), a collection of 33 microgravity experiments housed inside the Spacelab. The goal of this mission was to test hardware, facilities, and procedures being developed in views of the long term research program on the future International Space Station. The mission, which was supposed to last 16 days was cut short because of problems with one of the Shuttle's three fuel cell power generation units. Mission duration was 95 hours and 12 minutes, traveling 1.5 million miles in 63 orbits of the Earth. In July 1997 the STS-83 mission was renamed as STS-94 and represented a re-flight of the MSL-1 Spacelab mission. This mission focused on materials andcombustion scienceresearch in microgravity. Mission duration was 376 hours and 45 minutes, traveling 6.3 million miles in 251 orbits of the Earth.[1][5][10]
Susan logged 472 hours in space over two missions and is the second woman to pilot a space shuttle. She recalled the first moments of piloting the space shuttle alongside the senior pilot and mission-in-charge.[3][11]
Looking down at Earth from space the first time … it's like every dream come true. Even though you’ve seen pictures of Earth from space, it's not the same as being in space and looking at Earth. It was very rewarding.
